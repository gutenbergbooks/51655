myth. Real origin in a rite, not in an evangel. The last hypothesis: a
political evangel that could not be later avowed. Incompatibility of
this view with the Gospels. Composition of the record. Why the

<h2 class="main">PREAMBLE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The problem of the historicity of the Jesus of the
Gospels has been discussed by me in large sections of two bulky books,
which in other sections deal with matters only indirectly connected
with this, while even the sections directly devoted to the problem
cover a good deal of mythological and anthropological ground which not
many readers may care to master. The &ldquo;myth theory&rdquo;
developed in them, therefore, may not be readily grasped even by
open-minded readers; and the champions of tradition, of whatever
school, have a happy hunting-ground for desultory misrepresentation and
mystification. It has been felt to be expedient, therefore, by
disinterested readers as well as by me, to put the problem in a clearer
form and in a more concise compass. The process ought to involve some
logical improvement, as the mythological investigation made in
<span class="sc">Christianity and Mythology</span> had been carried out
independently of the anthropological inquiry made in <span class=
"sc">Pagan Christs</span>, and the theory evolved may well require
unification. In particular, the element of <i>Jewish</i> mythology
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e497" href="#xd21e497" name=
"xd21e497">xii</a>]</span>calls for fuller development. And the highly
important developments of the myth theory by Professor Drews and
Professor W. B. Smith have to be considered with a view to
co-ordination.</p>
<p class="par">To such a re-statement, however, certain preliminary
steps are necessary. The ground needs to be cleared (1) of &agrave;
priori notions as to the subject matter; (2) of mistaken opinions as to
a supposed &ldquo;consensus of critics&rdquo;; and (3) of uncritical
assumptions as to the character of the Gospel narratives.</p>
<p class="par">Writers who have not gone very deeply into problems of
normal history, however they may have specialized in the Biblical, are
still wont to assert that the historicity of non-supernatural data in
the Sacred Books is on all fours with that of the subject matter of
&ldquo;profane&rdquo; history. Indeed it is still common to hear it
claimed that the Resurrection is as well &ldquo;attested&rdquo; as the
assassination of Julius C&aelig;sar, or even better. In exactly the
same tone and spirit did the traditionalists of a previous generation
assert that the stoppage of the sun and moon in the interest of Joshua
was better attested than any equally ancient historical narrative.
Those who have decided to abandon the supernatural reduce the claim, of
course, to the historicity of the Trial and Crucifixion; but as to
these they confidently repeat the old formulas. Yet in point of fact
they have made no such critical scrutiny of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e503" href="#xd21e503" name=
"xd21e503">xiii</a>]</span>even these items as historians have long
been used to make, with destructive results, into many episodes of
ancient history&mdash;for instance, the battle of Thermopyl&aelig; and
the founding of the Spartan constitution by Lycurgus. Men who affect to
dismiss the myth theory as an ungrounded speculation are all the while
taking for granted the historicity of a record which is a mere tissue
of incredibilities.</p>
<p class="par">It has been justly remarked that serious risk of error
is set up even by the long-current claim of naturalist critics to
&ldquo;treat the Bible like any other book.&rdquo; Even in their
meaning the phrase should have run: &ldquo;like any other Sacred Book
of antiquity&rdquo;; inasmuch as critical tests and methods are called
for in the scrutiny of such books which do not apply in the case of
others. But inasmuch, further, as the Christian Sacred Books form a
problem by themselves, a kind of scrutiny which in the case of other
books of cult-history might substantially reveal all the facts may here
easily fail to do so.</p>
<p class="par">The unsuspecting student, coming to a narrative in which
supernatural details are mingled with &ldquo;natural,&rdquo; decides
simply to reject the former and take as history what is left. It is the
method of the amateur mythologists of ancient Greece, derided by
Socrates, and chronically resuscitated in all ages by men seeking short
cuts to certitude where they have no right to any. If the narrative of
the Trial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e509" href="#xd21e509"
name="xd21e509">xiv</a>]</span>and Crucifixion, thus handled, is found
to be still incredible in point of time-arrangement, the adaptor meets
the difficulty by reducing the time-arrangement to probability and
presenting the twice redacted result as &ldquo;incontestable&rdquo;
history. All this, as will be shown in the following pages, is merely a
begging of the question. A scientific analysis points to a quite
different solution, which the na&iuml;f &ldquo;historical&rdquo;
student has never considered.</p>
<p class="par">He is still kept in countenance, it is true, by
&ldquo;specialists&rdquo; of the highest standing. The average
&ldquo;liberal&rdquo; theologian still employs the explanatory method
of Toland; and anthropologists still offer him support. Thus Sir James
Frazer, by far the most learned collector of mytho-anthropological lore
in his age, positively refuses to apply to the history of the Christian
cult his own express rule of mythology&mdash;formulated before
him<a class="noteref" id="xd21e513src" href="#xd21e513" name=
"xd21e513src">1</a> but independently reiterated by him&mdash;that
&ldquo;all peoples have invented myths to explain why they observed
certain customs,&rdquo; and that a graphic myth to explain a rite is
presumptively &ldquo;a simple transcript of a ceremony&rdquo;; which is
the equivalent of the doctrine of Robertson Smith, that &ldquo;in
almost every case the myth was derived from the ritual, and not the
ritual from the myth,&rdquo; and of the doctrine of K. O. M&uuml;ller
that &ldquo;the mythus sprang from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e522" href="#xd21e522" name="xd21e522">xv</a>]</span>worship, and
not the worship from the mythus.&rdquo; What justification Sir James
can give for his refusal to act on his own principles is of course a
matter for full and careful consideration. But at least the fact that
he <i>has</i> to justify the refusal to apply in a most important case
one of the best-established generalizations of comparative mythology is
not in this case a recommendation of the principle of authority to
scientific readers.</p>
<p class="par">General phrases, then, as to how religions <i>must</i>
have originated in the personal impression made by a Founder are not
only unscientific presuppositions but are flatly contradictory, in this
connection, of a rule scientifically reached in the disinterested study
of ancient hierology in general.</p>
<p class="par">It is a delusion, again, to suppose, as do some
scholarly men, that there is such a consensus of view among New
Testament scholars as to put out of court any theory that cancels the
traditionalist assumption of historicity which is the one position that
most of them have in common. As we shall see, the latest expert
scholarship, professionally recognized as such, makes a clean sweep of
their whole work; but they themselves, by their insoluble divisions,
had already discredited it. Any careful collection of their views will
show that the innumerable and vital divergences of principle and method
of the various schools, and their constant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e534" href="#xd21e534" name=
"xd21e534">xvi</a>]</span>and emphatic disparagement of each
other&rsquo;s conclusions, point rather to the need for a radically
different theory and method. A theory, therefore, which cancels their
conflicts by showing that all the data are reducible to order only when
their primary assumption is abandoned, is entitled to the open-minded
attention of men who profess loyalty to the spirit of science.</p>
<p class="par">There is need, thirdly, to bring home even to many
readers who profess such loyalty, the need for a really critical study
of the Gospels. I have been blamed by some critics because, having
found that sixty years&rsquo; work on the documents by New Testament
scholars yielded no clear light on the problem of origins, I chose to
approach that by way (1) of mythology, (2) of extra-evangelical
literature and sect-history, and (3) of anthropology. The question of
the order and composition of the Gospels, in the view of these critics,
should be the first stage in the inquiry.</p>
<p class="par">Now, for the main purposes of the myth-theory, the
results reached by such an investigator as Professor Schmiedel were
quite sufficient; and though at many points textual questions had to be
considered, it seemed really not worth while to discuss in detail the
quasi-historical results claimed by the exegetes. But it has become
apparent that a number of readers who claim to be
&ldquo;emancipated&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e540" href=
"#xd21e540" name="xd21e540">xvii</a>]</span>have let themselves be put
off with <i>descriptions</i> of the Gospel-history when they ought to
have read it attentively for themselves. A confident traditionalist,
dealt with hereinafter, writes of the &ldquo;pretentious futilities
into which we so readily drop when we talk about them [the Gospels]
instead of reading them.&rdquo; The justice of the observation is
unconsciously but abundantly illustrated by himself; and he certainly
proves the need for inducing professed students to read with their eyes
open.</p>
<p class="par">Early in 1914 there was published a work on <span class=
"sc">The Historical Christ</span>, by Dr. F. C. Conybeare, in which, as
against the myth hypothesis, which he vituperatively assailed, a simple
perusal of the Gospel of Mark (procurable, as he pointed out, for one
penny) was confidently prescribed as the decisive antidote to all
doubts of the historicity of the central figure. The positions put were
the conventional ones of the &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; school. No note was
taken of the later professional criticism which, without accepting the
myth-theory, shatters the whole fabric of current historicity doctrine.
But that is relatively a small matter. In the course of his treatise,
Dr. Conybeare asserted three times over, with further embellishments,
that in the Gospel of Mark Jesus is &ldquo;presented quite naturally as
the son of <i>Joseph and his wife</i> Mary, and we learn quite
incidentally the names of his brothers <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e554" href="#xd21e554" name="xd21e554">xviii</a>]</span>and
sisters.&rdquo; Dr. Conybeare&rsquo;s printers&rsquo; proofs, he
stated, had been read for him by Professor A. C. Clark. I saw, I think,
fully twenty newspaper notices of the book; and in not a single one was
there any recognition of the gross and thrice-repeated blunder above
italicized, to modify the chorus of uncritical assent. A professed
Rationalist repeated and endorsed Dr. Conybeare&rsquo;s assertion.
Needless to say, not only did Dr. Conybeare not mention that Joseph is
never named in Mark, he never once alluded to the fact that in the same
Gospel Mary is presented as <i>not</i> the mother of Jesus; and the
brothers and sisters, by implication, as <i>not</i> his brothers and
sisters.</p>
<p class="par">When aggressive scholars and confident reviewers thus
alike reveal that they have not read the Gospels with the amount of
attention supposed to be bestowed on them by an intelligent
Sunday-school teacher, it is evidently inadvisable to take for granted
any general critical preparation even among rationalistic readers.
Before men can realize the need for a new theoretic interpretation of
the whole, they must be invited to note the vital incongruities (as
apart from miracle stories) in each Gospel singly, as the lay
Freethinkers of an earlier generation did without pretending to be
scholars.</p>
<p class="par">Those Rationalists are ill-advised who suppose that, in
virtue of having listened to latter-day publicists <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e566" href="#xd21e566" name=
"xd21e566">xix</a>]</span>who profess to extract a non-supernatural
&ldquo;religion&rdquo; <i>from</i> the supernaturalisms of the past,
they have reached a higher and truer standpoint than that of the men
who made sheer truth their standard and their ideal. Really scholarly
and scrupulous advocates of theism are as zealous to expose the
historical truth as the men who put that first and foremost; it is the
ethical sentimentalists who put the question of historic truth on one
side. The fact that some men of scientific training in other fields
join at times in such complacent constructions does not alter the fact
that they are non-scientific. The personal equation even of a man of
science is not science. On these as on other sides of the intellectual
life, &ldquo;opinion of store is cause of want,&rdquo; as Bacon has
it.</p>
<p class="par">Some of us who in our teens critically read the sacred
books first and foremost to clear our minds on the general question of
supernaturalism, and then proceeded to try, with the help of the
documentary scholars, to trace the history of religion as matter of
anthropology and sociology, had the experience of being told by
Professor Huxley, whose own work we had followed, that we were still at
the standpoint of Voltaire. Later we had the edification of seeing
Huxley expatiate upon topics which had long been stale for Secularist
audiences, and laboriously impugn the story of the Flood and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e573" href="#xd21e573" name=
"xd21e573">xx</a>]</span>the miracle of the Gadarene swine in
discursive debate with Gladstone, even making scientific mistakes in
the former connection.</p>
<p class="par">In view of it all, it seems still a sound discipline to
treat all opinions as for ever open to revision, and at the same time
to doubt whether the acceptance of any popular formula will place us in
a position to disparage unreservedly all our critical predecessors. If
we find reason to dismiss as inadequate the conclusions of many
scholars of the past, orthodox and heterodox, we are not thereby
entitled to speak of the best of them otherwise than as powerful minds
and strenuous toilers, hampered by some of their erroneous assumptions
in the task of relieving their fellows of the burden of others.</p>
<p class="par">It is precisely the habituation of the professional
scholars to working in a special groove that has so retarded the
progress of New Testament criticism. The re-discussion of the
historicity question that has followed upon the modern exposition of
the myth-theory has involved the reiteration by the historicity school
of a set of elementary claims from the long-discredited interpolation
in Josephus and the pagan &ldquo;testimonies&rdquo; of Suetonius and
Tacitus; and Professor W. B. Smith has had to meet these with a
detailed rebuttal such as used to be made&mdash;of course with less
care and fullness&mdash;on the ordinary English Secularist platform
forty or even seventy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e579" href=
"#xd21e579" name="xd21e579">xxi</a>]</span>years ago. Less advanced
scholars once more begin to recognize the nullity of the argument from
the famous passage in the <span class="sc">Annals</span> of
Tacitus,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e584src" href="#xd21e584" name=
"xd21e584src">2</a> which was clear to so many unpretending
freethinkers in the past; and to other <i lang="de">Gelehrten vom
Fach</i> it has to be again pointed out that the <i lang="it">impulsore
Chresto</i> of Suetonius, so far from testifying to the presence of a
Christian multitude at Rome under Nero&mdash;a thing so incompatible
with their own records&mdash;is rather a datum for the myth-theory,
inasmuch as it posits a cult of a Chr&#275;stos or Christos out of all
connection with the &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; movement.</p>
<p class="par">The passage in Josephus was given up long ago by
hundreds of orthodox scholars as a palpable interpolation, proved as
such by the total silence in regard to it of early Fathers who would
have rejoiced to cite it if it had been in existence. The device of
supposing it to be a Christian modification of a different testimony by
Josephus is a resort of despair, which evades altogether the fact of
the <i>rupture of context</i> made by the passage&mdash;a feature only
less salient in the paragraph of Tacitus. But even if there were no
reason to suspect the latter item of being a late echo <i>from</i>
Sulpicius Severus, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e604" href=
"#xd21e604" name="xd21e604">xxii</a>]</span>is assumed to have copied
it, nothing can be proved from it for the historicity of the Gospel
Jesus, inasmuch as it does but set forth from a hostile standpoint the
ordinary Christian account of the beginnings of the cult. Those who at
this time of day found upon such data are further from an appreciation
of the evidential problem than were their orthodox predecessors who
debated the issue with Freethinkers half a century ago.</p>
<p class="par">I have thought it well, then, to precede a restatement
of the &ldquo;myth-theory&rdquo; with a critical survey in which a
number of preliminary questions of scientific method and critical ethic
are pressed upon those who would deal with the main problem aright; and
a certain amount of controversy with other critical schools is indulged
in by way of making plain the radical weakness of all the conventional
positions. The negative criticism, certainly, will not establish in
advance the positive theory: that must meet the ordeal of criticism
like every other. But the preliminary discussion may at once serve to
free from waste polemic the constructive argument and guard readers
against bringing to that a delusive light from false assumptions.</p>
<p class="par">A recent and more notorious exhibition of
&ldquo;critical method&rdquo; by Dr. Conybeare has satisfied me that it
is needless to offer any further systematic exposure of the nullity of
his treatise, with which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e610" href=
"#xd21e610" name="xd21e610">xxiii</a>]</span>I had dealt at some length
in <span class="sc">The Literary Guide</span>. His memorable attack
upon the Foreign Secretary, and his still more memorable retractation,
may enable some of his laudatory reviewers to realize the kind of
temper and the kind of scrutiny he brings to bear upon documents and
theories that kindle his passions. All that was relevant in his
constructive process was really extracted, with misconceptions and
blunders and exaggerations, from the works of a few scholars of
standing who, however inconclusive their work might be, set him a
controversial example which he was unable to follow. In dealing with
them, I have the relief of no longer dealing with him. As to the
constructive argument from comparative mythology, anthropology, and
hierology, attacked by him and others with apparently no grasp of the
principles of any of these sciences, objections may be best dealt with
incidentally where they arise in the restatement of the case.</p>
<p class="par">For the rest, I can conceive that some will say the
second year of the World War is no time for the discussion even of a
great problem of religious history. I answer that the War has actually
been made the pretext for endless religious discussions of the most
futile kind, ranging between medieval miracle-mongering and the lowest
forms of journalistic charlatanism, with chronic debates on theism
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e617" href="#xd21e617" name=
"xd21e617">xxiv</a>]</span>and on the military value of faith and
prayer. The newspaper discussions on theism, in particular, reveal a
degree of philosophic <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> on the theistic side
which seems to indicate that that view of the universe has of late
years been abandoned by most men capable of understanding the logical
problem. When dispute plays thus uselessly at the bidding of emotion
there must be some seniors, or others withheld from war service, who in
workless hours would as lief face soberly an inquiry which digs towards
the roots of the organized religion of Europe. If the end of the search
should be the conviction that that system took shape as naturally as
any other cult of the ancient world, and that the sacrosanct records of
its origin are but products of the mythop&oelig;ic faculty of man, the
time of war, with its soul-shaking challenge to the sense of reality,
may not be the most unfit for the experience. <span class=

<h2 class="label"><span class="sc">Chapter I</span></h2>
<h2 class="main">THE SNARE OF PRESUPPOSITION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">He who would approach with an alert mind such a
question as that of the historic actuality of the Gospel Jesus would do
well to weigh a preliminary warning. Though after four hundred years of
chronic scientific discovery all men are supposed to know the
intellectual danger of a confident and foregone rejection of new
theories, it is scarcely likely that the vogue of such error is at an
end. After all, apart from the special experience in question, and from
the general effect of the spread of &ldquo;science,&rdquo; the average
psychosis of men is not profoundly different from what it was in the
two centuries which passed before the doctrines of Copernicus found
general acceptance. Not many modern novelties of thought can so
reasonably be met with derision as was the proposition that the earth
moves round the sun.</p>
<p class="par">Let the ingenuous reader try to make the supposition
that he had been brought up in ignorance of that truth, and without any
training in astronomy, and that in adolescence or mature years it had
been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>casually put to him as a non-authoritative
suggestion. Would he have been quick to surmise that the paradox might
be truth? Let him next try to imagine that he had been educated by an
eccentric guardian in the Ptolemaic creed, which accounted so plausibly
for so many solar and stellar phenomena, and that until middle life he
had been kept unaware of the Copernican heresy. Can he be sure that,
meeting it not as an accredited doctrine but as a novel hypothesis, he
would have been prompt to recognize that it was the better solution? If
he can readily say Yes, I know not whether his confidence is enviable
or otherwise. Reading in Sylvester&rsquo;s translation of the
<span class="sc">Divine Weeks</span> of Du Bartas, which had such vogue
in the days of James VI, the confident derision and
&ldquo;confutation&rdquo; of the heliocentric theory, I really cannot
be sure that had I lived in those days I should have gone right where
Bacon went wrong.</p>
<p class="par">To a mere historical student, not conscious of any
original insight into the problems of nature, there ought to be
something chastening in the recollection that every great advance in
the human grasp of them has been hotly or hilariously denounced and
derided; and that not merely by the average ignoramus, but by the mass
of the experts. It was not the peasants of Italy who refused to look
through Galileo&rsquo;s telescope&mdash;they were not invited to; it
was the academics, deep in Aristotle. It was not the laity who
distinguished themselves by rejecting Harvey&rsquo;s discovery of the
circulation of the blood; it was all the doctors above forty then
living, if we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>can believe a professional saying. And it was not
merely the humdrum Bible-readers who scouted geology for generations,
or who laughed consumedly for decades over the announcement that Darwin
made out men to be &ldquo;descended from monkeys.&rdquo; That theory,
as it happened, had been unscientifically enough propounded long before
Darwin; and, albeit not grounded upon any such scientific research as
served to establish the Darwinian theory in a generation, yet happened
to be considerably nearer rationality than the Semitic myth which
figured for instructed Christendom as the absolute and divinely
revealed truth on the subject. A recollection of the hate and fury with
which geologists like Hugh Miller repelled the plain lesson of their
own science when it was shown to clash with the sacred myth, and a
memory of the roar of derision and disgust which met Darwin, should set
reasonable men on their guard when they find themselves faced by
propositions which can hardly seem more monstrous to this generation
than those others did to our fathers and grandfathers.</p>
<p class="par">It is difficult, again, without suggesting contempt of
that scholarship which as concerning historical problems is the
equivalent of experimental research in science, to insist aright upon
the blinding tendency of pure scholarship in the face of a radically
innovating doctrine. Without scholarly survey no such doctrine can
maintain itself. Yet it is one of the commonest of experiences to find
the accredited scholars among the last to give an intelligent hearing
to a new truth. Only for a very few was skill <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>in the
Ptolemaic astronomy a good preparation towards receiving the
Copernican. The errors of Copernicus&mdash;the inevitable errors of the
pioneer&mdash;served for generations to establish the Ptolemaists in
theirs. And where religious usage goes hand-in-hand with an error, not
one man in a thousand can escape the clutch of the double habit.</p>
<p class="par">Hence the special blackness of the theological record in
the history of culture. In the present day the hideous memory of old
crimes withholds even the clerical class as a whole from the desire to
employ active persecution; but that abstention&mdash;forced in any
case&mdash;cannot save the class from the special snare of the belief
in the possession of fixed and absolute truth. Since the day when
Tyndale was burned for translating the Sacred Books, English Christians
have passed through a dozen phases of faith, from the crassest
evangelicalism to the haziest sentimentalism, and in all alike they
have felt, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, the same spontaneous aversion to
the new doctrine that disturbs the old. Who will say that the stern
Tyndale, had he ever been in power, would not have made martyrs in his
turn? The martyr Latimer had applauded the martyrdom of Anabaptists.
The martyred Cranmer had assented to martyrdoms in his day, though a
man forgiving enough in respect of his own wrongs. And if the educated
Christians of to-day have reached a level at which they can recognize
as old delusions not only the beliefs in relics and images and
exorcisms, once all sacrosanct, but the &ldquo;literal&rdquo;
acceptance of Semitic and Christian myths and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>miracle-stories, to whom do they think they owe the
deliverance? To their accredited teachers? Not so.</p>
<p class="par">No false belief from which men have been delivered since
the day of Copernicus has been dismissed without strenuous resistance
from men of learning, and even from men of vigorous capacity. The
belief in witchcraft was championed by Bodin, one of the most powerful
minds of his day; Glanvill, who sought to maintain it in England after
the Restoration, was a man of philosophical culture and a member of the
Royal Society; and he had the countenance of the Platonist Henry More
and the chemist Boyle. So great a man as Leibnitz repulsed the
cosmology of Newton on the score that it expelled God from the
universe. It was not professional theologians who invented the
&ldquo;higher criticism&rdquo; of the Pentateuch, any more than they
introduced geology. Samuel Parvish, the Guildford bookseller, who
discovered in the days of Walpole that Deuteronomy belonged to the
seventh century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, is not recorded to have
made any clerical converts; and Astruc, the Parisian physician who
began the discrimination between the Jehovistic and Elohistic sources
in Genesis in 1753, made no school in his country or his time.
Voltaire, no Hebraist, demonstrated clearly enough that the
Pentateuchal tale of the tabernacle in the wilderness was a fiction;
but three toiling generations of German specialists passed the
demonstration by, till a Zulu convert set the good Bishop Colenso upon
applying to the legend the simple tests of his secular arithmetic. Then
the experts began slowly to see the point. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">To all such reminders the present-day expert will
reply, belike, that he does not need them. He, profiting by the past,
can commit no such errors. And yet, however right the present members
of the apostolic succession of truth-monopolists may be, there is an
astonishing likeness in their tone and temper over the last heresy to
that of their predecessors, down to the twentieth generation. Anger and
bluster, boasting and scolding, snarl and sneer, come no less
spontaneously to the tongues of the professional defender of the
present minimum of creed than they did to those of the full-blooded
breed of the ages of the maximum, or of Calvin and Bonner. From the
defence of the &ldquo;real presence&rdquo; of the God to that of the
bare personal existence of the Man is a long descent; but there is a
singular sameness in the manner of the controversy. As their expert
ancestors proved successively the absolute truth of the corporal
presence in the wafer, or the humanity of the Son against those who
dubbed him merely divine, or his divinity against those who pronounced
him merely human, or the inerrancy of the Gospels against the
blasphemers who pointed out the contradictions, or the historic
certainty of the miracles and the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>and the Ascension against the
&ldquo;materialists&rdquo; who put such Christian myths on a level with
Pagan, so do the expert demonstrators of the bare historicity of the
now undeified God establish by vituperation and derision, declamation
and contempt, the supreme certainty of the minimum after all the
supernatural certainties are gone. Even as Swiss patriots undertook to
demonstrate &ldquo;somebody&rdquo; and &ldquo;something&rdquo; behind
the legend of William Tell when it had ceased to be possible to burn
men at the stake for exposing the apple-myth, so do the descendants of
the demonstrators of the real presence now go about to make clear the
real existence.</p>
<p class="par">I speak, of course, of the ruck of the vindicators, not
of the believers; and Professor Schmiedel and M. Loisy, I trust, will
not suspect me of classing them with men many of whom are as hostile to
them as to the thesis which those scholars seek by rational methods to
confute. Professor Schmiedel has even avowed that a proof of the
non-historicity of the Gospel Jesus would not affect his inner
religious opinions; and such high detachment has been attained to by
others. That civilized scholars credit, and might at a pinch maintain
in debate, the historicity of the Gospel Jesus as calmly as they might
the historicity of Lycurgus against its impugners, I am well aware. And
to such readers, if I have the honour to obtain any, I address not a
warning but an appeal. There is an attitude towards the problem which
incurs no reproach on the score of tone and temper, and which will
naturally recommend itself all the more to men of real culture, but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>which yet, I think, only illustrates in another way
the immense difficulty of all-round intellectual vigilance. Let me give
an example in an extract from a rather noteworthy pronouncement upon
the question in hand:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Of Paul&rsquo;s divine Master no biography can
ever be written. We have a vivid impression of an unique, effulgent
personality. We have a considerable body of sayings which <i>must be
genuine because they are far too great to have been invented by His
disciples</i>, and, for the rest, whatever royal robes and tributes of
devotion the Church of <span class="sc">A.D</span>. 70&ndash;100
thought most fitting for its king. The Gospels are the creation of
faith and love: faith and love hold the key to their interpretation.
(Canon Inge, art. &ldquo;St. Paul&rdquo; in <i>Quarterly Review</i>,
Jan., 1914, p. 45.)</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">I am not here concerned to ask whether the closing words
are the expression of an orthodox belief; or what orthodoxy makes of
the further proposition that &ldquo;With St. Paul it is quite
different. He is a saint without a luminous halo.&rdquo; The idea seems
to be that concerning the saint without a nimbus we can get at the
historical truth, while in the other case we cannot&mdash;a proposition
worth orthodox attention. But what concerns the open-minded
investigator is the logic of the words I have italicized. It is obvious
that they proceed (1) on the assumption that what non-miraculous
biography the Gospels give is in the main absolutely
trustworthy&mdash;that is to say, that the accounts of the disciples
and the teaching are historical; and (2) on the assumption that we are
historically held to the traditional view that the Gospel sayings
originated with the alleged Founder as they purport. It is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>necessary to
point out that this is not a licit historical induction. Even Canon
Inge by implication admits that not all the Gospel sayings have the
quality which he regards as certifying authenticity; and on no
reasonable ground can he claim that the others must have been
&ldquo;invented by the disciples.&rdquo; The alternative is spurious.
No one is in a position to deny that any given saying may have been
invented by non-disciples. In point of fact, many professional
theologians are agreed in tracing to outside sources some tolerably
fine passages, such as the address to Jerusalem (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2023:37">Mt. xxiii,
37</a>; <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2013:34">Lk. xiii,
34</a>). The critics in question do not ascribe that deliverance to
inventive disciples; they infer it to have been a non-Christian
document. Many other critics, again, now pronounce the whole Sermon on
the Mount&mdash;regarded by Baur as signally genuine&mdash;a
compilation from earlier Hebrew literature, Biblical and other. Which
then are the &ldquo;great&rdquo; sayings that could not be thus
accounted for? Without specification there can be no rational
discussion of the problem; and even the proposition about the exegetic
function of &ldquo;faith and love&rdquo; affects to be in itself
rational.</p>
<p class="par">The plain truth would seem to be that Canon Inge has
formed for himself no tenable critical position. He has merely
reiterated the fallacy of Mill, who in his <i>Three Essays on
Religion</i> (pp. 253&ndash;54) wrote:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Whatever else may be taken away from us by
rational criticism, Christ is still left; a unique figure, not more
unlike all his precursors than all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10"
href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>his followers, even those who
had the direct benefit of his personal teaching. It is of no use to say
that Christ as exhibited in the Gospels is not historical, and that we
know not how much of what is admirable has been superadded by the
tradition of his followers. The tradition of followers suffices to
insert any number of marvels, and may have inserted all the miracles
which he is reputed to have wrought. But who <i>among his disciples or
among their proselytes</i> was capable of inventing the sayings
ascribed to Jesus, or of imagining the life and character revealed in
the Gospels? Certainly not the fishermen of Galilee; as certainly not
St. Paul, whose character and idiosyncrasies were of a totally
different sort; still less the early Christian writers, in whom nothing
is more evident than that the good which was in them was all derived,
as they always professed that it was derived, from the higher source.
What <i>could</i> be added and interpolated by a disciple we may see in
the mystical parts of St. John, matter imported from Philo and the
Alexandrian Platonists and put into the mouth of the Saviour in long
speeches about himself such as the other Gospels contain not the
slightest vestige of, though pretended to have been delivered on
occasions of the deepest interest and when his principal followers were
all present; most prominently at the last supper. The East was full of
men who could have stolen (!) any quantity of this poor stuff, as the
multitudinous Oriental sects of Gnostics afterwards did. But about the
life and sayings of Jesus there is a stamp of personal originality
combined with profundity of insight which, if we abandon the idle
expectation of finding scientific precision where something very
different was aimed at, must place the Prophet of Nazareth, even in the
estimation of those who have no belief in his inspiration, in the very
first rank of men of sublime genius of whom our species can boast. When
this pre-eminent genius is combined with the qualities of probably the
greatest moral <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>reformer, and martyr to that mission, who ever
existed on earth, religion [<i>sic</i>] cannot be said to have made a
bad choice in pitching on this man as the ideal representative and
guide of humanity.... Add that, to the conception of the rational
sceptic, it remains a possibility that Christ actually was what he
supposed himself to be&mdash;not God, for he never made the smallest
pretension to that character, and would probably have thought such a
pretension as blasphemous as it seemed to the men who condemned
him&mdash;but a man charged with a special, express, and unique
commission from God to lead mankind to truth and virtue....</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par"><i lang="de">Ein historischer Kopf hatte er nicht</i>,
is a German economist&rsquo;s criticism of Mill which I fear will have
to stand in other fields than that of economics. The man who wrote this
unmeasured dithyramb can never have read the Gospels and the Hebrew
books with critical attention; and can never have reflected critically
upon his own words in this connection. The assumption that &ldquo;the
fishermen of Galilee&rdquo; could not have attained to thoughts which
are expressly alleged to have been put forth by an untaught carpenter
of Galilee is on the face of it a flight of thoughtless declamation.
Had Mill ever critically read the Old Testament and the Apocrypha, he
must have been aware that the main precepts of the Sermon on the Mount,
which are presumably among the unspecified objects of his panegyric,
were all there beforehand. Had he taken the trouble to investigate
before writing, he could have found in Hennell&rsquo;s <i>Inquiry</i>
(1838), which popularized the old research of Schoettgen; in
Nork&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Rabbinische Quellen und Parallelen</i>
(1839); and in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span><i lang="fr">Les Origines du Sermon de la
Montagne</i> by Hippolyte Rodrigues (1868), a copious demonstration of
the Jewish currency of every moral idea in the Christian document,
often in saner forms. And he ought to have known from his own reading
that the doctrine of forgiveness for injuries, which appears to be the
main ground for the customary panegyric of the Sermon, was common to
Greeks and Romans before the Gospels were compiled. From the duty of
giving alms freely&mdash;which is repeatedly laid down in the Old
Testament&mdash;to that of the sin of concupiscence and the wrongness
of divorce for trivial causes, every moral idea in the Sermon had been
formulated alike by Jews and Gentiles beforehand.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e737src" href="#xd21e737" name="xd21e737src">1</a> And if it be
argued that the <i>compilation</i> of such a set of precepts with a
number of religious dicta (equally current in non-Christian Jewry) is
evidence of a special ethical or religious gift in the compiler, the
answer is that precisely the fact of such a compilation is the disproof
of the assertion in the Gospels that the whole was delivered as a
sermon on a mountain. A sermon it never was and never could be; and if
the compiler was a man of unique character and qualification he was
<i>not</i> the Gospel Jesus but the very type of which Mill denied the
possibility!</p>
<p class="par">That the Gospel ethic is non-original becomes more and
more clear with every extension of relevant research. The <span class=
"sc">Testaments of the Twelve <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=
"#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>Patriarchs</span>, written between
109 and 106 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> by a Quietist Pharisee, is
found to yield not only origins or anticipations for pseudo-historic
data in the Gospels but patterns for its moral doctrine. Thus the
notion that the Twelve Apostles are to rule over the tribes in the
Messianic kingdom is merely an adaptation of the teaching in the
<span class="sc">Testaments</span> that the twelve sons of Jacob are so
to rule.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e763src" href="#xd21e763" name=
"xd21e763src">2</a> There too appears for the first time in Jewish
literature the formula &ldquo;on His right hand&rdquo;;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e768src" href="#xd21e768" name="xd21e768src">3</a>
and a multitude of close textual parallels clearly testify to perusal
of the book by the Gospel-framers and the epistle-makers. But above all
is the Jewish book the original for the doctrines of forgiveness and
brotherly love. Whereas the Old Testament leaves standing the ethic of
revenge alongside of the prescription to forgive one&rsquo;s enemy, the
<span class="sc">Testaments</span> give out what a highly competent
Christian editor pronounces to be &ldquo;the most remarkable statement
on the subject of forgiveness in all ancient literature. They show a
wonderful insight into the true psychology of the question. So perfect
are the parallels in thought and diction between these verses [<i>Test.
Gad</i>, vi, 3&ndash;7] and <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

must assume our Lord&rsquo;s acquaintance with them</i>. The meaning of
forgiveness in both cases is the highest and noblest known to
us&mdash;namely, the restoring the offender to communion with us, which
he had forfeited through his offence.... We now see the importance of
our text. It shows that pre-Christian <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

system of ethics on the subject of forgiveness.&rdquo;<a class=

<p class="par">Here the tribute goes to a Pharisee; in another
connection it redounds to the other butt of Christian disparagement,

<p class="par">It is only for men partly hypnotized by sectarian creed
that there can be anything surprising in these anticipations. The
notion that Sacred Books contain the highest and rarest thought of
their respective periods is a delusion that any critical examination of
probabilities will destroy. Relatively high and rare thought does
<i>not</i> find its way into Sacred Books; what these present is but
the thought that is perceptible and acceptable to the majority, or a
strong minority, of the better people; and it is never purified of
grave imperfection, precisely because these never are. Perfect ethic is
the possession of the perfect people, an extremely rare species. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>ethic of the <span class="sc">Testaments</span>,
which is an obvious improvement on that of average Jewry, is in turn
imperfect enough; even as that of the Gospels remains stamped with
Jewish particularism, and is irretrievably blemished by the grotesquely
iniquitous doctrine of damnation for non-belief.</p>
<p class="par">Such asseverations as Mill&rsquo;s, constantly repeated
as they are by educated men, are simply expressions of failure to
comprehend the nature and the possibilities of life, of civilization,
of history. The thesis is that in a world containing no one else
capable of elevated thought, moral or religious, there suddenly
appeared a marvellously inspired teacher, who chose a dozen disciples
incapable of comprehending his doctrine, and during the space of one or
many years&mdash;no one can settle whether one or two or three or four
or ten or twenty&mdash;went about alternately working miracles and
delivering moral and religious sayings (including a doctrine of eternal
hell-fire for the unrepentant wicked, among whom were included all who
refused to accept the new teaching); and that after the execution of
the teacher on a charge of blasphemy or sedition the world found itself
in possession of a supernormal moral and religious code, which
constituted the greatest &ldquo;moral reform&rdquo; in the
world&rsquo;s history. The very conception is a chimera. In a world in
which no one could independently think the teacher&rsquo;s moral
thoughts there could be no acceptance of them. If the code was
pronounced good, it was so pronounced in terms of the moral nature and
moral convictions of those who made the pronouncement. The very
propagandists <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>of the creed after a few generations were found
meeting gainsayers with the formula <i lang="la">anima naturaliter
Christiana</i>.</p>
<p class="par">Christianity made its way precisely because (1) it
<i>was</i> a construction from current moral and religious material;
and because (2) it adopted a system of economic organization already
tested by Jews and Gentiles; and (3) because its doctrines were
ascribed to a God, not to a man. Anything like a moral renovation of
the world it never effected; that conception is a chimera of chimeras.
While Mill, the amateur in matters of religious research, who
&ldquo;scarcely ever read a theological book,&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e855src" href="#xd21e855" name="xd21e855src">8</a> ascribed to
Christian morality a unique and original quality, Newman, the
essentially religious man, deliberately affirmed with the Rationalists
that &ldquo;There is little in the ethics of Christianity which the

<h2 class="main">ILLUSIONS AS TO GOSPEL ETHIC</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Strictly speaking, the whole problem of the moral
value and the historical effects of Christianity lies outside the
present issue; but we are forced to face it when the question of the
<i>truth</i> of its historic basis is dismissed by a professed logician
with a rhetorical thesis to the effect that &ldquo;religion cannot be
said to have made a bad choice in pitching on&rdquo; the personality of
which he is challenged to prove the historicity. Mill answers the
challenge by begging the question; and where he was capable of such a
course multitudes, lay and clerical, will long continue to be so. For
Mill the problem was something extraneous to his whole way of thought.
Broadly speaking, he never handled a historical problem, properly so
called. Other defenders of the historicity of Jesus, in turn, charge a
want of historic sense upon all who venture to put the hypothesis that
the Gospel Jesus is a mythical creation. The charge has been repeatedly
made by men who can make no pretence of having ever independently
elucidated any historical problem; and in one notable case, that of Dr.
J. Estlin Carpenter, it is made by a scholar who has committed himself
to the assertion of the historicity of Krishna. Such resorts to blank
asseveration in such <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19"
name="pb19">19</a>]</span>matters are on all fours with the blank
asseveration that the Gospel Jesus, in virtue of the teachings ascribed
to him, is a figure too sublime for human invention.</p>
<p class="par">The slightest reflection might obtrude the thought that
it is precisely the invented figure that can most easily be made
quasi-sublime. Is it pretended that Yahweh is <i>not</i> sublime? Is
the Book of Job pretended to be historical? The Gospel Jesus is never
shown to us save in a series of statuesque presentments, healing,
preaching, prophesying, blessing, denouncing, suffering; he is
expressly detached from domestic relationships; of his life apart from
his Messianic career there is not a vestige of trace that is not
nakedly mythical; of his mental processes there is not an attempt at
explanation save in glosses often palpably incompetent; and of his plan
or purpose, his hopes or expectations, no exegete has ever framed a
non-theological theory that will stand an hour&rsquo;s examination.
Those who claim as an evidence of uniqueness the fact that he is never
accused by the evangelists of any wrong act do but prove their
unpreparedness to debate any of the problems involved. A figure
presented as divine, in a document that aims at establishing a cult, is
<i>ipso facto</i> denuded of errancy so far as the judgment of the
framers of the picture can carry them. But all that the framers and
redactors of the Gospels could achieve was to outline a figure
answering to <i>their</i> standards of perfection, free of what
<i>they</i> regarded as sin or error. Going to work in an age and an
environment in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>which ascetic principles were commonly posited as
against normal practice, they guard the God from every suggestion of
carnal appetite; and the dialecticians of faith childishly ask us to
contrast him with ancient Pagan deities whose legends are the unsifted
survivals of savage folklore. As if <i>any</i> new Sacred Book in the
same age would not have proceeded on the same standards; and as if the
religious Jewish literature of the age of Christian beginnings were not
as ascetic as the other. But inasmuch as the compilers of the Gospels
could not transcend the moral standard of their time, they constantly
obtrude its limitations and its blemishes. Had Mill attempted anything
beyond his dithyramb, he would have been hard put to it to apply his
ecstatic epithets to such teachings as these:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">When such a mass of unmanageable doctrines is forced on
the notice of the dithyrambists, there promptly begins a process of
elimination&mdash;the method of Arnold, to which Mill would doubtless
have subscribed, denying as he did that Jesus ever claimed to be the
Son of God. Whatever is not sweetly reasonable in the Gospels, said
Arnold, <i>cannot</i> be the word of Jesus; let us then pick and choose
as we will. And justly enough may it be argued that we have been
listening to different voices. It cannot be the same man who prohibited
all anger, vetoing even the use of &ldquo;Thou fool,&rdquo; and then
proceeded to vituperate Scribes and Pharisees in the mass as sons of
hell; to curse a barren tree; and to call the erring &ldquo;Ye fools
and blind&rdquo;&mdash;any more than it was the same man who said,
&ldquo;I am meek and lowly in heart,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A greater than
Solomon is here,&rdquo; or annulled precepts of the law after declaring
that not a jot or tittle of it should pass away. But with what
semblance of critical righteousness shall it be pretended that in a
compilation thus palpably composite it was <i>the</i> teacher who said
all the right things and others who said all the wrong, when as a
matter of documentary fact the better sayings can all be paralleled in
older or contemporary writings? That challenge is never so much as
faced by the dithyrambists; to face it honestly would be the beginning
of their end.</p>
<p class="par">Some seem prepared to stake all on such a teaching
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>as the parable of the Good Samaritan, which
actually teaches that a man of the religiously despised race could
humanely succour one of the despising race when religious men of the
same race passed him by. Is the parable then assimilated by those who
stress it? Can they conceive that a Samaritan <i>could</i> so act? If
yes, why cannot they conceive that a Samaritan, or another Jew than
one, could put forth such a doctrine? Here is a story of actual
human-kindness, paralleled in a hundred tales and romances of later
times, a story which, appealing as it does to every reader, may
reasonably be believed to have been <i>enacted</i> a thousand times by
simple human beings who never heard of the Gospels. Yet we are asked to
believe that only one Jewish or Gentile mind in the age of Virgil was
capable of drawing the moral that the kindly and helpful soul is the
true neighbour, and that the good man will be neighbourly to all; so
rebuking the tribalism of the average Jew.</p>
<p class="par">When, fifteen years ago, I wrote of &ldquo;the moderate
ethical height of the parable of the Good Samaritan, which is partly
precedented in Old Testament teaching [<a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2023:7">Deut. xxiii,
7</a>&mdash;an interpolation; cp. the <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ruth">Book of
Ruth</a>],&rdquo; Dr. J. E. Carpenter indignantly replied: &ldquo;The
field of Greek literature is open; will Mr. Robertson take the Good
Samaritan and from Plato to Plotinus find his match?&rdquo; And the
Rev. Thomas James Thorburn, D.D., LL.D., in his later work <span class=
"sc">Jesus the Christ: Historical or Mythical?</span> (1912), wrote (p.
68):&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Dr. Estlin Carpenter has invited (we believe, in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>vain!) Mr. Robertson to produce an equal to this
same parable out of the whole range of Greek literature, which
undoubtedly contains the choicest teaching of the ancient world.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Dr. Thorburn in his bibliography cited the first
<i>and</i> second (<i>1912</i>) editions of <span class="sc">Pagan
Christs</span>; he thoughtfully omitted, in launching his &ldquo;we
believe, in vain!&rdquo;, to ascertain whether there had been a second
edition of <span class="sc">Christianity and Mythology</span>, in which
any reply I might have to make to Dr. Carpenter might naturally be
expected to appear, that critic having challenged the proposition as
put in the first edition. A second edition <i>had</i> appeared, in
<i>1910</i>, and there I had duly given the simple answer which the two
learned Doctors of Divinity, so conscious of knowing all Greek
literature from Plato to Plotinus, were unable to think of for
themselves. The field of Greek literature, as Dr. Carpenter justly
observes, is open; and it would have been fitting on his part to
perambulate a little therein. The demanded instance lay to the hand of
unlearned people in so familiar an author as Plutarch&mdash;in the tale
of Lycurgus and Alcander. As Dr. Thorburn and Dr. Carpenter, however,
must be supposed to have been ignorant of that story, it may be well to
tell it briefly here.</p>
<p class="par">Lycurgus having greatly exasperated the rich citizens by
proposing the institution of frugal common meals, they made a tumult
and stoned him in the market-place, so that he had to run for sanctuary
in a temple. But one of his pursuers, a violent youth named Alcander,
caught up with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>him, and, striking him with a club as he turned
round, dashed out one of his eyes. Lycurgus then stood calmly facing
the citizens, letting them see his bleeding face, and his eye
destroyed. All who saw him were filled with shame and remorse. They
gave up Alcander to his mercy, and conducted Lycurgus in procession to
his house to show their sympathy. He thanked them and dismissed them,
but kept Alcander with him. He did him no harm, and used no reproachful
words, but kept him as his servant, sending away all others. And
Alcander, dwelling with Lycurgus, noting his serenity of temper and
simplicity of life and his unwearying labours, became his warmest
admirer, and ever after told his friends that Lycurgus was the best of
men. In one version of the tale Lycurgus gave back his freedom to
Alcander in presence of the citizens, saying, You gave me a bad
citizen; I give you back a good one.</p>
<p class="par">If our Doctors of Divinity are unable to see that this
represents a rarer strain of goodness than the deed of the Good
Samaritan, they must be told that they are lacking in that very moral
judgment upon which they plume themselves. Forever sitting in the chair
of judgment, defaming all who dissent from them, they are ethically
less percipient than the cultured laity. Thousands of kindly human
beings, I repeat, have succoured wounded strangers, even those of
hostile races; and the tone held over the Gospel parable by some
Christians is but the measure of their misconception of human nature.
Their sectarian creed has bred in them a habit of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>aspersing all humanity, all character, save the
Christian, thus stultifying the very lesson of their parable, the
framer of which would fain have taught men to transcend these very
fanaticisms. They will not be &ldquo;neighbours&rdquo; to the pagan to
the extent of crediting him with their own appreciation of magnanimity
and human-kindness; they cannot even discuss his claim without seeking
arrogantly to browbeat his favourers. Forever acclaiming the beauty of
the command to forgive injuries, they cannot even debate without
insolence where they know their sectarian claims are called in
question. And I shall be agreeably disappointed if they proceed to
handle the tale of Lycurgus and Alcander without seeking to demonstrate
that somehow it falls below the level of the Gospels, where, as it
happens, the endurance of violence and death by the God-man is in
effect presented as God-like. But for that matter, even the oft-cited
saying &ldquo;Father, forgive them,&rdquo; occurs only in Luke of all
the Gospels, and, being absent from two of the most ancient codices,
betrays itself as a late addition to the text. It may be either Jewish
or Gentile. For Plutarch, the Spartan tale is something edifying and
gratifying, but he makes no parade of it as a marvel; and in his essay
<span class="sc">Of Profiting by our Enemies</span> he speaks of the
forgiveness of enemies as a thing not rarely to be met with:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">To forbear to be revenged of an enemy if
opportunity and occasion is offered, and to let him go when he is in
thy hands, is a point of great humanity and courtesy; but him that hath
compassion of him when he is fallen into adversity, succoureth him in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>distress, at his request is ready to show goodwill
to his children, and an affection to sustain the state of his house and
family being in affliction, who doth not love for this kindness, nor
praise the goodness of his nature? (<i>Holland&rsquo;s
translation.</i>)</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Had that passage appeared in a Gospel, how would not our
Doctors of Divinity have exclaimed over the moral superiority of
Christian ethic, demonstrating that it alone appealed to the heart! In
actual fact we find them denying that such passages exist. The most
disgraceful instance known to me appears to implicate an Austrian
theologian. In the &ldquo;Editor&rsquo;s Forewords&rdquo; to the Early
English Text Society&rsquo;s volume of <span class="sc">Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s Englishings</span> there is a note on
Plutarch&rsquo;s <span class="sc" lang="la">De Curiositate</span>,
&agrave;propos of Elizabeth&rsquo;s translation of that
essay:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">In <i lang="la">De Curiositate</i>, as well as in
his other writings, Plutarch proves himself to be a true Stoic
philosopher, to possess first-rate moral principles and great fear of
God.... His religious views sometimes remind us, like those of Seneca,
of Christian teaching; but here there is always one important
omission&mdash;viz., the commendation of charity or brotherly love;
<i>of this Christian virtue the stoic, so virtuous in his own
relations, knows absolutely nothing</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">At the close of the &ldquo;Forewords&rdquo; the Editor,
Miss Caroline Pemberton, mentions that &ldquo;The comments on the
writings of Boethius and Plutarch are by Dr. J. Schenk, of Meran,
Tyrol.&rdquo; To Dr. Schenk, then, must apparently be credited the
high-water mark in Christian false-witness against paganism. Either he
did or he did not know that Plutarch in other writings had given full
expression to the ethic of brotherly love. If he did not know,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>he was not only framing a wanton libel in sheer
ignorance but giving a particularly deadly proof of his own destitution
of the very virtue he was so unctuously denying to the pagan. A man
devoid not merely of charity but of decent concern for simple justice
poses as a moral teacher in virtue of his Christianism; even as the
professional encomiasts of the parable of the Good Samaritan
demonstrate their own blindness to its meaning, playing the Levite to
the Pagan.</p>
<p class="par">Plutarch, so much better a man than his Christian
critic, was in turn no innovator in ethics. As every student knows,
such doctrines as those above cited from him are far older than the
Christian religion. Five centuries before the Christian era Confucius
put the law of reciprocity in the sane form of the precept that we
should not do unto others what we would not that they should do unto
us. Are we to suppose that the rule had been left to Confucius to
invent? Christians who cannot conform to it are not ashamed to
disparage the precept of Confucius as a &ldquo;negative&rdquo;
teaching, implying that there is a higher moral strain in their formula
which prescribes the doing to others what we would wish them to do to
us. There, if any difference of code be really intended, we are urged
to confer benefits in order to have them returned. If no difference is
intended, the disparagement is mere deceit. In the ancient Hindu epic,
the <i>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</i>, it is declared that &ldquo;The Gods
regard with delight the man who ... when struck does not strike
again,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;The good, when they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>promote
the welfare of others, <i>expect no reciprocity</i>.&rdquo; How long
are we to listen to the childish claim that moral maxims which in India
were delivered millenniums ago by forgotten men were framable in
Seneca&rsquo;s day only in Syria, and there only by one &ldquo;unique
and effulgent&rdquo; personality, whose mere teaching lifted humanity
to new heights? Had no nameless man or woman in Greece ever urged the
beauty of non-retaliation before Plato?</p>
<p class="par">If clerics cannot rise above the old disingenuous
sectarian spirit, it is time at least that laymen should. The more
historic comprehension a man has of the ancient world, of
Plutarch&rsquo;s world, with all its sins and delusions, the less can
he harbour the notion of the moral miracle involved in the thesis of
the unique teacher, suddenly revealing to an amazed humanity heights of
moral aspiration before undreamt of. And any considerate scrutiny of
the <i>logia</i> of the Gospels will inevitably force the open-minded
student to recognize multiplicity of thought and ideal, and compel him
to seek some explanation. An effort to detach a possible personality by
the elimination of impossible adjuncts is the next natural step.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">For anyone who will soberly and faithfully face
the facts there must sooner or later arise the problem, Is there
<i>any</i> unifying personality behind this medley of many sets of
doctrines, many voices, many schools? Even if it were possible to piece
together from it a coherent body of either ethical or religious
thought, and jettison the rest, is there any reason to believe that the
selected matter belongs to the Gospel Teacher with the Twelve
Disciples, crucified on the morning after the Passover under Pontius
Pilate? When the crowning doctrine of sacrament and sacrifice is seen
to be but the consummation of a religious lore beginning in prehistoric
and systematic human sacrifice, and traceable in a score of ancient
cults, is it possible to claim that the palpably dramatic record of
Last Supper, Agony, Betrayal, Trial, and Crucifixion is a historic
record of a strange coincidence between cult practice and biography?
And if that goes, what is left? If, says Loisy, the condemnation of
Jesus as pretended Messiah by Pilate &ldquo;could be put in doubt, one
would have no motive for affirming the existence of
Christ.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1124src" href="#xd21e1124"
name="xd21e1124src">1</a> And it can! <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Some, assuming to settle the problem by rhetoric, in
effect stand for a &ldquo;personality&rdquo; without any pretence of
establishing what the &ldquo;personality&rdquo; taught. And this
inexpensive device will doubtless long continue to be practised by the
large class who insist upon solving all such problems by instinct. An
example of that procedure is afforded by an article headed &ldquo;A
Barren Controversy,&rdquo; by the Rev. Frederick Sinclair, in a
magazine entitled <span class="sc">Fellowship</span>, the organ of the
Free Religious Fellowship, Melbourne, issue of March, 1915. The
controversy is certainly barren enough as Mr. Sinclair conducts it. His
religious temper is of a familiar type. &ldquo;It is a hard task to
prove the obvious,&rdquo; he begins; &ldquo;and no obligation is laid
on us to examine and refute the evidences alleged in support of this or
that cock-and-bull theory.&rdquo; We can imagine how the reverend
critic would have shone in the sixteenth or the seventeenth century,
disposing of the Copernican theory, which so presumptuously assailed
&ldquo;the obvious.&rdquo; True to his principles, he does not hamper
himself by meeting arguments or evidence. &ldquo;Mythical theories
about Christ have about as much scientific value and importance as the
theories of the Baconians about Shakespeare. They ... are products ...
of that perverted credulity which will swallow anything, so long as it
is not orthodox; and they are best met by the method of satire adopted
by Whately in his &lsquo;Historic Doubts&rsquo; on Napoleon.&rdquo; And
yet our expert renounces that admirable instrument in favour of the
simpler procedure vulgarly known as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32"
href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>&ldquo;bluff.&rdquo; He is in
reality a good example of the psychosis of the very Baconism which he
contemns, and which he would probably be quite unable to confute. An
&aelig;sthetic impression of &ldquo;reality&rdquo; derived from a
hypnotized perusal of Mark, and a feeling that only one man could
deliver such oracles, are the beginning and end of his dialectic and
scholarly stock-in-trade; even as a consciousness that Bacon
<i>must</i> be the author of the Plays, and that the actor Shakespeare
<i>could not</i> have written them, is the beginning and end of the
ignorant polemic of the Baconists.</p>
<p class="par">To do him justice, it should be noted that Mr. Sinclair
warns his readers both before and after his case that his handling of
the theme and their preparation for estimating it leave a great deal to
be desired by those who care to see applied &ldquo;the method of
careful criticism.&rdquo; Still, he is satisfied that it is
&ldquo;adequate to the particular question we have been
considering.&rdquo; And this is how Mr. Sinclair has
considered:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Anyone who will pay this controversy the
compliment of a few hours&rsquo; consideration is advised to bring his
own judgment to bear on it in the following way: Let him begin by
taking a copy of St. Mark&rsquo;s Gospel, which is the earliest of the
four, in either of the English versions, and read it through, pencil in
hand, striking out all the miraculous or quasi-miraculous stories.
Then, gathering up what remains, let him read it, first as a whole,
then singly, episode by episode, always keeping the eye of the
imagination open, dismissing as far as possible any prepossessions, and
letting the author make his own impression, without the interfering
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>offices of critic or commentator. Having done
this, let the reader ask of himself of each story: Is this a story
which <i>seems</i> to belong to actual life, to be told of a real human
being, with distinct individuality, or is it rather a <i>literary
invention</i>, designed to <i>add</i> something to a
<i>conventional</i> figure? Does the narrative move with the freedom
and variety of life, or does it fit into a <i>conventional, symmetrical
design</i>? Does the writer&rsquo;s style and method arouse the
suspicion of <i>literary artifice</i>? Must one say of this or that
story that its reality is the reality of life, or of an art which
<i>cunningly counterfeits life</i>?</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The open-minded reader, I trust, will hardly need to be
told that what is here done is to set a false problem and ignore the
real issue. Mr. Sinclair either cannot understand that issue or elects
to evade it. Probably the former is the explanation. No critic of the
Gospels, so far as I remember, ever suggested that any of them
&ldquo;cunningly counterfeits life&rdquo;; and certainly no one ever
pretended that Mark<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1175src" href=
"#xd21e1175" name="xd21e1175src">2</a> exhibits a &ldquo;conventional,
symmetrical design,&rdquo; though Wilke argued that it &ldquo;freely
moulded the traditional historical material in pursuance of literary
aims,&rdquo; and B. Weiss praises its literary colouring. It is a heap
of unreal incident, fortuitously collocated,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1181src" href="#xd21e1181" name="xd21e1181src">3</a> and showing
nothing approaching to symmetrical design. &ldquo;Conventional&rdquo;
raises another question; in this as in all the Gospels there is plenty
of convention. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Let us but follow for a little the simple method of
selection prescribed by Mr. Sinclair, and see what we get. What we are
to make of <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%201:1-9">Mark i,
1&ndash;9</a>, is far from clear. It sets forth the advent of John as
the fulfilment of a prophecy&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a miracle; and it
describes his mission in the baldest conceivable summary, save for the
sentence: &ldquo;And John was clothed with camel&rsquo;s hair, and had
a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild
honey.&rdquo; Is this &ldquo;convention&rdquo; or
&ldquo;reality&rdquo;? I am not inclined to call it &ldquo;literary
artifice,&rdquo; unless we are to apply that description to the
beginning of the average nursery tale, as perhaps we should. What must
strike the inquiring reader is that if we were to have a touch of
&ldquo;reality&rdquo; about the Baptist we should be told something
about his inner history, his antecedents, and what he preached. What we
<i>are</i> told is that &ldquo;he preached, saying, There cometh after
me he that is mightier than I.... I baptized you with water; but he
shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">If this part of the narrative has not been &ldquo;struck
out&rdquo; by Mr. Sinclair&rsquo;s neophytes as plainly belonging to
the miraculous, the next five verses presumably must be. The
non-miraculous narrative begins at <i>v.</i> 14:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Now, <i>after that John was delivered up</i>,
Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of God, and saying, The
time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent ye, and
<i>believe in the Gospel</i> [not a word of which has been
communicated].</p>
<p class="par">And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon
and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>net in the sea; for they
were fishers. And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will
make you to become fishers of men. And straightway they left the nets,
and followed him. And going on a little further, he saw James the son
of Zebedee and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the
nets. And straightway he called them; and they left their father
Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">This &ldquo;episode,&rdquo; for Mr. Sinclair,
&ldquo;seems to belong to real life, to be told of a real human being
with distinct individuality.&rdquo; For critical readers it is a
primitive &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; narrative, told by a writer who
has absolutely no historic knowledge to communicate. Of the preaching
of the Saviour he has no more to tell than of the preaching of the
Baptist. Both are as purely &ldquo;conventional,&rdquo; so far, as an
archaic statue of Hermes. Of &ldquo;the freedom and variety of
life&rdquo; there is not a trace; Mr. Sinclair, who professes to find
these qualities, is talking in the manner of a showman at a fair. The
important process of making disciples resolves itself into a fairy
tale: &ldquo;Come and I will make you fishers of men; and they
came.&rdquo; A measure of &ldquo;literary artifice&rdquo; is perhaps to
be assigned to the items of &ldquo;casting a net,&rdquo; &ldquo;mending
the net,&rdquo; and &ldquo;left their father in the boat with the hired
servants&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1223src" href="#xd21e1223"
name="xd21e1223src">4</a> but it is the literary art of a thousand
fairy tales, savage and civilized, and stands for the method of a
narrator who is dealing with purely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36"
href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>conventional figures, not with
characters concerning which he has knowledge. The calling of the first
disciples in the rejected Fourth Gospel has much more semblance of
reality.</p>
<p class="par">If the cautious reader is slow to see these plain facts
on the pointing of one who is avowedly an unbeliever in the historic
tradition, let him listen to a scholar of the highest eminence, who,
after proving himself a master in Old Testament criticism, set himself
to specialize on the New. Says Wellhausen: &ldquo;The Gospel of Mark,
in its entirety, lacks the character of history.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1230src" href="#xd21e1230" name="xd21e1230src">5</a>
And he makes good his judgment in detail:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Names of persons are rare: even Jairus is not
named in [codex] D. Among the <i lang="la">dramatis person&aelig;</i>
it is only Jesus who distinctively speaks and acts; the antagonists
provoke him; the disciples are only figures in the background. But of
what he lived by, how he dwelt, ate, and drank, bore himself with his
companions, nothing is vouchsafed. It is told that he taught in the
synagogue on the Sabbath, but no notion is given of the how; we get
only something of what he said outside the synagogue, usually through a
special incident which elicits it. The normal things are never related,
only the extraordinary.... The scantiness of the tradition is
remarkable.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1241src" href="#xd21e1241" name=
"xd21e1241src">6</a></p>
<p class="par">The local connection of the events, the itinerary,
leaves as much to be desired as the chronological; seldom is the
transit indicated in the change of scene. Single incidents are often
set forth in a lively way, and this without any unreal or merely
rhetorical devices, but they are only anecdotally related, <i lang=
"la">rari nantes in gurgite vasto</i>. They do not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>amount
to material for a life of Jesus. And one never gets the impression that
an attempt had been made among those who had eaten and drunk with him
to give others a notion of his personality.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1253src" href="#xd21e1253" name="xd21e1253src">7</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Wellhausen, it is true, finds suggestions of a real and
commanding personality; but they are very scanty, the only concrete
detail being the watching the people as they drop their offerings into
the collecting-chest! &ldquo;Passionate moral sensibility distinguishes
him. He gives way to divine feeling in anger against the oppressors of
the people and in sympathy with the lowly.&rdquo; But here too there is
qualification:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">But in Mark this motive for miracles seldom comes
out. They are meant to be mainly displays of the Messiah&rsquo;s power.
Mark does not write <i lang="la">de vita et moribus Jesu</i>: he has
not the aim of making his person distinguishable, or even intelligible.
It is lost for him in the divine vocation; he means to show that Jesus
is the Christ.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1266src" href="#xd21e1266"
name="xd21e1266src">8</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Then we have a significant balancing between the
perception that Mark is not history, and that, after all, it is
practically all there is:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Already the oral tradition which he found had been
condensed under the influence of the standpoint from which he set out.
He is silent on this and that <i>which he can omit as being known to
his readers&mdash;for instance, the names of the parents of Jesus
(!)</i>. Nevertheless, he has left little that is properly historical
for his successors to glean after him; and what they know in addition
is of doubtful worth....</p>
<p class="par">Why is not something more, and something more
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>trustworthy, reported of the intercourse of the
Master with his disciples? It would rather seem that the narrative
tradition in Mark did not come directly from the intimates of Jesus. It
has on the whole a somewhat rude and demotic cast, as if it had
previously by a long circulation in the mouth of the people come to the
rough and drastic style in which it lies before us.... Mark took up
what the tradition carried to him.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Such is the outcome of a close examination by an
original scholar who takes for granted the historicity of Jesus. It is
a poor support to a pretence of finding a lifelike narrative.</p>
<p class="par">If the reader under Mr. Sinclair&rsquo;s tutelage will
at this point vary his study somewhat (at the cost of a few extra
hours) by reading samples of quite primitive folk-lore&mdash;say the
<span class="sc">Hottentot Fables and Tales</span> collected by Dr.
Bleek, in which the characters are mostly, but not always, animals; or
some of the fairy tales in Gill&rsquo;s <span class="sc">Myths and
Songs of the South Pacific</span>&mdash;and then proceed to the tale of
<span class="sc">Tom Tit Tot</span>, as given by Mr. Edward Clodd in
the dialect of East Anglia, he will perhaps begin to realize that
unsophisticated narrators not only can but frequently do give certain
touches of quasi-reality to &ldquo;episodes&rdquo; which no civilized
reader can suppose to have been real. In particular he will find in the
vivacious <span class="sc">Tom Tit Tot</span> an amount of &ldquo;the
freedom and variety of life&rdquo; in comparison with which the archaic
stiffness and bareness of the Gospel narrative is as dumb-show beside
drama. And if he will next pay some attention to the narrative of
Homer, in which Zeus and H&ecirc;r&ecirc; are so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>much
more life-like than a multitude of the human personages of the epic,
and then turn to see how Plutarch writes professed biography, some of
it absolutely mythical, but all of it on a documentary basis of some
kind, he will perhaps begin to suspect that Mr. Sinclair has not even
perceived the nature of the problem on which he pronounces, and so is
not in a position to &ldquo;consider&rdquo; it at all. Plutarch is
nearly as circumstantial about Theseus and Herakles and Romulus as
about Solon. But when he has real biographical material to go upon as
to real personages he gives us a &ldquo;freedom and variety of
life&rdquo; which is as far as the poles asunder from the hieratic
figures of the Christian Gospel. Take his Fabius Maximus. After the
pedigree, with its due touch of myth, we read:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">His own personal nickname was Verrucosus, because
he had a little wart growing on his upper lip. The name of Ovicula,
signifying sheep, was also given him while yet a child, because of his
slow and gentle disposition. He was quiet and silent, very cautious in
taking part in children&rsquo;s games, and learned his lessons slowly
and with difficulty, which, combined with his easy obliging ways with
his comrades, made those who did not know him think that he was dull
and stupid. Few there were who could discern, hidden in the depths of
his soul, his glorious and lion-like character.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">This is biography, accurate or otherwise. Take again the
<span class="sc">Life of Pericles</span>, where after the brief account
of parentage, with the item of the mother&rsquo;s dream, we get
this:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">His body was symmetrical, but his head was long
out of all proportion; for which reason in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>nearly
all his statues he is represented wearing a helmet; as the sculptors
did not wish, I suppose, to reproach him with this blemish.... Most
writers tell us that his tutor in music was Damon, whose name they say
should be pronounced with the first syllable short. Aristotle, however,
says that he studied under Pythocleides. This Damon, it seems, was a
sophist of the highest order....</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;biographer&rdquo; who so satisfies Mr.
Sinclair&rsquo;s sense of actuality has not one word of this kind to
say of the youth, upbringing, birthplace, or appearance of the Teacher,
who for him was either God or Supreme Man. Seeking for the alleged
&ldquo;freedom and variety of life&rdquo; in the narrative, we go on to
read:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">And they go into Capernaum; <i>and straightway on
the sabbath day</i> he entered into the synagogue and taught. And they
were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as having
authority, and not as the scribes. <i>And straightway</i> there was in
their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">and straightway we are back in the miraculous. Mr.
Joseph McCabe, who in his excellent book on the <span class=
"sc">Sources of the Morality of the Gospels</span> avows that he holds
by the belief in a historical Jesus, though unable to assign to him
with confidence any one utterance in the record, fatally anticipates
Mr. Sinclair by remarking that &ldquo;If the inquirer will try the
simple and interesting experiment of eliminating from the Gospel of
Mark all the episodes which essentially involve miracle, he will find
the remainder of the narrative amazingly paltry.&rdquo; To which
verdict does the independent reader begin to incline? Thus the
&ldquo;episodes&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41"
name="pb41">41</a>]</span>continue, after three paragraphs of the
miraculous:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">And in the morning, <i>a great while before
day</i>, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and
there prayed. And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;
and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee. And he
saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may
preach there also; for to this end came I forth. And he went into their
synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out
devils.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">It would seem sufficient to say that Mr. Sinclair, with
his &ldquo;freedom and variety of life,&rdquo; is incapable of critical
reflection upon what he reads. In the opening chapter we have not a
single touch of actuality; the three meaningless and valueless touches
of detail (&ldquo;a great while before day&rdquo; is the third) serve
only to reveal the absolute deficit of biographical knowledge. We have
reiterated statements that there was teaching, and not a syllable of
what was taught. The only utterances recorded in the chapter are parts
of the miracle-episodes, which we are supposed to ignore. Let us then
consider the critic&rsquo;s further asseveration:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">It will be observed that certain <i>distinct</i>
traits appear in the central figure, and that these traits are not
merely those of the conventional religious hero, but the more simple
human touches of anger, pity, indignation, despondency, exultation;
these scattered touches, <i>each so vivid</i>, fuse into a natural and
intelligible whole. The Jesus of Mark is a real man, who moves and
speaks and feels like a man (!)&mdash;&ldquo;a creature not too bright
or good for human nature&rsquo;s daily food&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">a notable variation from the more familiar thesis of the
&ldquo;sublime&rdquo; and &ldquo;unique&rdquo; figure of current
polemic. Looking for the alleged details, we find Jesus calling the
fifth disciple: &ldquo;He saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose and
followed him&rdquo;&mdash;another touch of &ldquo;freedom and
variety.&rdquo; Then, after a series of Messianic utterances, including
a pronouncement against Sabbatarianism of the extremer sort, comes the
story of the healing of the withered hand, with its indignant
allocution to &ldquo;them&rdquo; in the synagogue: &ldquo;Is it lawful
on the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm, to save a life or to
kill?&rdquo; Here, in a miracle story, we have an intelligible protest
against Sabbatarianism: is it the protest or the indignation that
vouches for the actuality of the protesting figure? Nay, if we are to
elide the miraculous, how are we to let the allocution stand?</p>
<p class="par">These protests against Sabbatarianism, as it happens,
are the first approximations to actuality in the document; and as such
they raise questions of which the &ldquo;instinctive&rdquo; school
appear to have no glimpse, but which we shall later have to consider
closely. In the present connection, it may suffice to ask the question:
Was anti-Sabbatarianism, or was it not, the first concrete issue raised
by the alleged Teacher? In the case put, is it likely to have been?
Were the miraculous healing of disease, and the necessity of feeding
the disciples, with the corollary that the Son of Man was Lord of the
Sabbath, salient features in a popular gospel of repentance in view of
the coming of the Kingdom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href=
"#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>of God? If so, it is in flat negation
of the insistence on the maintenance of the law in the Sermon on the
Mount (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%205:17-20">Mt. v,
17&ndash;20</a>), which thus becomes for us a later imposition on the
cultus of a purely Judaic principle, in antagonism to the other. That
is to say, a movement which <i>began</i> with anti-Sabbatarianism was
after a time joined or directed by Sabbatarian Judaists, for whom the
complete apparatus of the law was vital. If, on the other hand,
recognizing that anti-Sabbatarianism, in the terms of the case, was not
likely to be a primary element in the new teaching, that its first
obtrusion in the alleged earliest Gospel is in an expressly Messianic
deliverance, and its second in a miracle-story, we proceed to
&ldquo;strike out&rdquo; both items upon Mr. Sinclair&rsquo;s
ostensible principles, we are deprived of the first touch of
&ldquo;indignation&rdquo; and &ldquo;anger&rdquo; which would otherwise
serve to support his very simple thesis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">SCHMIEDEL AND DEROGATORY MYTH</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">From this point onwards, every step in the
investigation will be found to convict the Unitarian thesis of absolute
nullity. It is indeed, on the face of it, an ignorant pronouncement.
The characteristics of &ldquo;anger, pity, indignation, despondency,
exultation,&rdquo; are all present in the myth of Herakles, of whom
Diodorus Siculus, expressly distinguishing between mythology and
history, declares (i, 2) that &ldquo;by the confession of all, during
his whole life he freely undertook great and continual labours and
dangers, in order that by doing good to the race of men he might win
immortal fame.&rdquo; Herakles was, in fact, a Saviour who &ldquo;went
about doing good.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1380src" href=
"#xd21e1380" name="xd21e1380src">1</a> The historicity of Herakles is
not on that score accepted by instructed men; though I have known
divinity students no less contemptuous over the description of the
cognate Samson saga as a sun myth than is Mr. Sinclair over the denial
of the historicity of Jesus.</p>
<p class="par">So common a feature of a hundred myths, indeed, is the
set of characteristics founded on, that we may at once come to the
basis of his argument, a blundering reiteration of the famous thesis of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>Professor Schmiedel, who is the sole source of Mr.
Sinclair&rsquo;s latent erudition. &ldquo;The line of inquiry here
suggested,&rdquo; he explains, &ldquo;has been worked out in a pamphlet
of Schmiedel, which will be found in the Fellowship library.&rdquo; But
the dialectic which broadly avails for the Bible class will not serve
their instructor here. The essence of the argument which Professor
Schmiedel urges with scholarlike sobriety is thus put by Mr. Sinclair
with the extravagance natural to his species:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first"><i>Many</i> [compare Schmiedel!] of the stories
represent him [Jesus] in a light which, from the point of view of
conventional hero-worship, is even derogatory; his friends come to
seize him as a madman; he is estranged from his own mother; he can do
no mighty work in the unsympathetic atmosphere of his own native
place.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The traditionalist is here unconsciously substituting a
new and different argument for the first. Hitherto the thesis has been
that of the &ldquo;vividness&rdquo; of the record, the &ldquo;human
touches,&rdquo; the &ldquo;speaking and feeling like a real man,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;freedom and variety of life.&rdquo; Apparently he has had a
shadow of misgiving over these simple criteria. If, indeed, he had
given an hour to the perusal of Albert Kalthoff&rsquo;s <span class=
"sc">Rise of Christianity</span>, instead of proceeding to vilipend a
literature of which he had read nothing, he would have learned that his
preliminary thesis is there anticipated and demolished. Kalthoff meets
it by the simple observation that the books of <span class=
"sc">Ruth</span> and <span class="sc">Jonah</span> supply &ldquo;human
touches&rdquo; and &ldquo;freedom and variety of life&rdquo; to a far
greater degree than does the Gospel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46"
href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>story considered as a life of
Jesus; though practically all scholars are now agreed that both of the
former books are deliberately planned fictions, or early &ldquo;novels
with a purpose.&rdquo; <span class="sc">Ruth</span> is skilfully framed
to contend against the Jewish bigotry of race; and <span class=
"sc">Jonah</span> to substitute a humane ideal for the ferocious one
embalmed in so much of the sacred literature. Yet so
&ldquo;vividly&rdquo; are the central personages portrayed that down
till the other day all the generations of Christendom, educated and
uneducated alike, accepted them unquestioningly as real records,
whatever might be thought by the judicious few of the miracle element
in <span class="sc">Jonah</span>.</p>
<p class="par">It is thus ostensibly quite expedient to substitute for
the simple thesis of &ldquo;vividness&rdquo; in regard to the second
Gospel the quite different argument that some of the details exclude
the notion that &ldquo;the author&rdquo; regarded Jesus as a
supernatural person. But this thesis instantly involves the defence in
fresh trouble, besides breaking down utterly on its own merits. In the
early chapters of Mark, Jesus is emphatically presented as a
supernormal person&mdash;the deity&rsquo;s &ldquo;beloved Son,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the Holy One of God,&rdquo; who has the divine power of
forgiving sins, is &ldquo;lord even of the sabbath,&rdquo; and is
hailed by the defeated spirits of evil as &ldquo;the Son of God,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Son of the Most High God.&rdquo; Either the conception
of Jesus in <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%206">Mark vi</a> is
compatible with all this or it is not. If <i>not</i>, the case
collapses, for the &ldquo;derogatory&rdquo; episode must be at once
branded as an interpolation. And if it be argued that even as an
interpolation it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>testifies at once to a non-supernaturalist view of
the Founder&rsquo;s function and a real knowledge of his life and
actions, we have only to give a list of more or less mythical names in
rebuttal. To claim that the episode in <a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%206:1-6">Mark vi,
1&ndash;6</a>, is &ldquo;derogatory from the point of view of
<i>conventional</i> hero-worship,&rdquo; and therefore presumptively
historical, is to ignore alike Jewish and Gentile hero-worship. In the
Old Testament Adam, Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Judah, Moses, Aaron, Samson,
David, and Solomon are all successively placed in
&ldquo;derogatory&rdquo; positions; and the Pagan hero-worshippers of
antiquity are equally with the Jewish recalcitrant to Mr.
Sinclair&rsquo;s conviction of what they ought to do.</p>
<p class="par">Professor Schmiedel is aware, though Mr. Sinclair
apparently is not, that Herakles in the myth is repeatedly placed in
&ldquo;derogatory&rdquo; positions, and is not only seized as a madman
but actually driven mad. The reader who will further extend Mr.
Sinclair&rsquo;s brief curriculum to a perusal of the <span class=
"sc">Bacch&aelig;</span> of Euripides will find that the God, who in
another story is temporarily driven mad by Juno, is there subjected to
even greater indignities than those so triumphantly specified by our
hierologist. Herakles and Dionysos, we may be told, were only demigods,
not Gods. But Professor Schmiedel&rsquo;s thesis is that for the writer
of Mark or of his original document Jesus was only a holy man. On the
other hand&mdash;to say nothing of the myths of Zeus and
H&ecirc;r&ecirc;, Ar&ecirc;s and Aphrodit&ecirc;, Hephaistos and
Poseidon&mdash;Apollo, certainly a God for the framers of <i>his</i>
myth, is there actually represented <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48"
href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>as being banished from heaven
and living in a state of servitude to Admetus for nine years. A God,
then, could be conceived in civilized antiquity as undergoing many and
serious indignities. These simple &agrave; priori arguments are apt to
miscarry even in the hands of careful and scrupulous scholars like
Professor Schmiedel, who have failed to realize that no amount of
textual scholarship can suffice to settle problems which in their very
nature involve fundamental issues of anthropology, mythology, and
hierology. As Professor Schmiedel is never guilty of browbeating, I
make no disparagement of his solid work on the score that he has not
taken account of these fields in his argument; but when his untenable
thesis is brandished by men who have neither his form of scholarship
nor any other, it is apt to incur summary handling.</p>
<p class="par">Elsewhere I have examined Professor Schmiedel&rsquo;s
thesis in detail.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1460src" href="#xd21e1460"
name="xd21e1460src">2</a> Here it may suffice to point out (1) as
aforesaid, that the argument from derogatory treatment is not in the
least a proof that in an ancient narrative a personage is not regarded
as superhuman; (2) that a <i>suffering</i> Messiah was expressly
formulated in Jewish literature in the pre-Christian period;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1480src" href="#xd21e1480" name="xd21e1480src">3</a>
and (3) that there are extremely strong grounds for inferring purposive
invention&mdash;of that na&iuml;f kind which marks the whole mass of
early hierology&mdash;in the very episodes upon which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>he
founds. The first concrete details of the Founder&rsquo;s propaganda in
Mark, as we have seen, exhibit him as clashing with the Judaic
environment. In later episodes he clashes with it yet further. The
&ldquo;derogatory&rdquo; episodes exhibit him as clashing with his
personal environment, his family and kin, concerning whom there has
been no mention whatever at the outset, where we should expect to find
it. All this is in line with the anti-Judaic element of the Gospel. If
at early stages in the larger Jesuine movement there were reasons why
the Founder should be represented as detaching himself from the Mosaic
law; as being misunderstood and deserted by his disciples; and as
disparaging even the listening Jewish multitude (concerning whom
<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%204:10">Mark, iv,
10</a> <i>sq.</i>, makes him say that &ldquo;unto them that are
without, all things are done in parables, that seeing they may see and
not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand, <i>lest
haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven
them</i>&rdquo;), is there anything unlikely in his being inventively
represented as meeting antipathetic treatment from his family?<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1501src" href="#xd21e1501" name="xd21e1501src">4</a>
At a time when so-called &ldquo;brothers of the Lord&rdquo; ostensibly
claimed authority in the Jud&aelig;o-Gentile community, an invented
tale of original domestic hostility to the Teacher would be as likely
as the presence of authorities so styled is unlikely on the assumption
that the story in Mark was all along current. The very fact that
allusions to the family of the Lord suddenly appear in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>record
which had introduced him as a heavenly messenger, without mention of
home or kindred or preparation, tells wholly against the originality of
the later details, which in the case of the naming of &ldquo;the
carpenter&rdquo; and his mother have a polemic purpose.<a class=

<p class="par first">All this applies, of course, to the
&ldquo;Primitive Gospel&rdquo; held to underlie all of the synoptics,
Mark included&mdash;a datum which reduces to comparative unimportance
the question of priority among these. As collected by the school of
Bernhard Weiss,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1522src" href="#xd21e1522"
name="xd21e1522src">1</a> the primitive Gospel, like Mark, set out with
a non-historical introduction of the Messiah to be baptized by John. It
then gives the temptation myth in full; and immediately afterwards the
Teacher is made to address to disciples (who have not previously been
mentioned or in any way accounted for) the Sermon on the Mount, with
variations, and without any mount. In this place we have the
uncompromising insistence on the Mosaic law; and soon, after some
miracles of healing and some Messianic discourses, including the
liturgical &ldquo;Come unto me all ye that labour,&rdquo; we have the
Sabbatarian question raised on the miracle of the healing of the man
with the dropsy, but without the argument from the Davidic eating of
the shewbread.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1528src" href="#xd21e1528"
name="xd21e1528src">2</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href=
"#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">There is no more of the colour of history here than in
Mark: so obviously is it wanting in both that the really considerate
exegetes are driven to explain that history was not the object in
either writing. In both &ldquo;the twelve&rdquo; are suddenly
sent&mdash;in the case of Mark, after a list of twelve had been
inserted without any reference to the first specified five; in the
reconstructed &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; document without any list
whatever&mdash;to preach the blank gospel, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is
at hand,&rdquo; with menaces for the non-recipient, the allocutions to
Chorazin and Bethsaida being here made part of the instructions to the
apostles.</p>
<p class="par">What, then, are the disciples supposed to have preached?
What had the Teacher preached as an evangel of &ldquo;the
Kingdom&rdquo;? The record has expressly represented that his parables
were incomprehensible to his own disciples; and when they ask for an
explanation they are told that the parables are expressly meant to be
unintelligible, but that to <i>them</i> an explanation is vouchsafed.
It is to the effect that &ldquo;the seed is the word.&rdquo; What word?
The &ldquo;Kingdom&rdquo;? The mystic allegories on that head are
avowedly not for the multitude: they could not have been. Yet those
allegories are the sole explanations ever afforded in the Gospels of
the formula of &ldquo;the Kingdom&rdquo; which was to be the purport of
the evangel of the apostles <i>to</i> the multitude. They themselves
had failed to understand the parables; and they were forbidden to
convey the explanation. What, then, had they to convey? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">And that issue raises another. Why were there disciples
at all? Disciples are understood to be prepared as participants in or
propagandists of somebody&rsquo;s teaching&mdash;a lore either exoteric
or esoteric. But no intelligible view has ever been given of the
purpose of the Gospel Jesus in creating his group of Twelve. If we ask
what he taught them, the only answer given by the documents is: (1)
Casting out devils; (2) The meaning of parables which were meant to be
unintelligible to the people: that is, either sheer thaumaturgy or a
teaching which was never to be passed on. On the economic life of the
group not one gleam of light is cast. Judas carried a
&ldquo;bag,&rdquo; but as to whence came its contents there is no hint.
The whole concept hangs in the air, a baseless dream. The myth-makers
have not even tried to make it plausible.</p>
<p class="par">The problems thus raised are not only not faced by the
orthodox exegetes; they are not <i>seen</i> by them. They take the most
laudable pains to ascertain what the primitive Gospel was like, and,
having settled it to the satisfaction of a certain number, they rest
from their labours. Yet we are only at the beginning of the main, the
historic problem, from which Baur recalled Strauss to the documentary,
with the virtual promise that its solution would clear up the
other.</p>
<p class="par">A &ldquo;higher&rdquo; criticism than that so-called, it
is clear, must set about the task; and its first conclusion, I suggest,
must be that there never was any Christian evangel by the Christ and
the Twelve. These allegories of the Kingdom are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>framed
to conceal the fact that the gospel-makers had no evangel to describe;
though it may be claimed as a proof of their forensic simplicity that
they actually represent the Founder as vetoing all popular explanation
of the very formula which they say he sent his disciples to preach to
the populace. <i>An</i> idea of the Kingdom of God, it may be argued,
was already current among the Jews: the documents assert that that was
the theme of the Baptist. Precisely, but was the evangel of Jesus then
simply the evangel of John, which it was to supersede? And was the
evangel of John only the old evangel, preached by Pharisees and others
from the time of the Maccabees onwards?<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1582src" href="#xd21e1582" name="xd21e1582src">3</a> Whatever it
was, what is the meaning of the repeated Gospel declaration that the
nature of the Kingdom must <i>not</i> be explained to the people? There
is only one inference. The story of the sending forth of the twelve is
as plainly mythical as is Luke&rsquo;s story of the sending forth of
the seventy, which even the orthodox exegetes abandon as a
&ldquo;symmetrical&rdquo; myth; though they retain the allocution
embodied in it. What is in theory the supreme episode in the early
propaganda of the cult is found to have neither historical content nor
moral significance. Not only is there not a word of explanation of the
formula of the evangel, there is not a word of description of the
apostles&rsquo; experience, but simply the usual negation of
knowledge:&mdash;</p>

raise the question: <i>Was there, then, an older cult of a Jesus-God in
Palestine?</i> Leaving that problem for the present, we can but note
that the report in effect tells that there was no evangel to preach. To
any reflecting mind, it is the utterance of men who had nothing to
relate, but are inserting an empty framework, wholly mythical, in a
void past. Themselves ruled by the crudest superstition, they do but
make the Divine Teacher talk on their own level, babbling of Satan
falling from heaven, and of treading on serpents. All the labours of
the generations of laborious scholars who have striven to get to the
foundations of their documents have resulted in a pastiche which only
the more clearly reveals the total absence of a historic basis such as
the Gospels more circumstantially suggest. In the end we have neither
history nor biography, but an absolutely <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>enigmatic evangel, set in
a miscellany of miracles and of discourses which are but devices to
disguise the fact that there had been no original evangel to preach. If
the early church had any creed, it was not this. It originated in a
<i>rite</i>, not in an evangel.</p>
<p class="par">One hypothesis might, indeed, be hazarded to save the
possibility of an actual evangel by the Founder. If, taking him to be
historical, we assume him to have preached a political doctrine
subversive of the Roman rule, and to have thereby met his death, we
could understand that, in a later period in which the writers connected
with the movement were much concerned to conciliate the Romans, it
might have been felt expedient, and indeed imperative, to suppress the
facts. They would not specify the evangel, because they dared not. On
this view the Founder was a Messiah of the ordinary Jewish type, aiming
at the restoration of the Jewish State. But such a Jesus would not be
the &ldquo;Jesus of the Gospels&rdquo; at all. He would merely be a
personage of the same (common) name, who in no way answered to the
Gospel figure, but had been wholly denaturalized to make him a
cult-centre. On this hypothesis there has been no escape from the
&ldquo;myth-theory,&rdquo; but merely a restatement of it. A Jesus put
to death by the Romans as a rebel Mahdi refuses to compose with the
Teacher who sends out his apostles to preach his evangel; who
proclaims, if anything, a purely spiritual kingdom; and who is put to
death as seeking to subvert the Jewish faith, the Roman governor giving
only a passive and reluctant assent. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>On the political
hypothesis, as on the myth-theory here put, the whole Gospel narrative
of the Tragedy which establishes the cult remains mythical. We have but
to proceed, then, with the analysis which reveals the manner of its
composition and of its inclusion in the record.</p>
<p class="par">It is admitted by the reconstructors that the primitive
Gospel had no conclusion, telling nothing of Last Supper, Agony,
Betrayal, Crucifixion, or Resurrection. It did not even name Judas as
the betrayer. And they explain that it was because of lacking these
details that it passed out of use, superseded by the Gospels which gave
them. As if the conclusion, were it compiled in the same fashion, could
not have been added to the original document, which <i lang="la">ex
hypothesi</i> had the prestige of priority. Why the composer of the
original did not add the required chapters is a question to which we
get only the most futile answers, as is natural when the exegetes have
not critically scrutinized the later matter. Thus even Mr. Jolley is
content to say:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The omission of any account of the Passion or
Resurrection is natural enough in a writing primarily intended for the
Christians of Jud&aelig;a, <i>some of them</i> witnesses of the
Crucifixion, and <i>all</i>, probably, familiar with the incidents of
the Saviour&rsquo;s Jud&aelig;an ministry, as well as with the events
preceding and following the Passion, especially when we remember that
the author had no intention (!) of writing a biography.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1637src" href="#xd21e1637" name=
"xd21e1637src">4</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Here the alleged fact that only <i>some</i> had seen the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>Crucifixion, while <i>all</i> knew all about the
ministry, is given as a reason why the ministry should be described and
the Crucifixion left undescribed and unmentioned!</p>
<p class="par">The problem thus impossibly disposed of is really of
capital importance. Any complete solution must remain hypothetical in
the nature of the case; but at least we are bound to recognize that the
Primitive Gospel may have had a <i>different</i> conclusion, as it may
further have contained matter not preserved in the synoptics.
<i>That</i> might well be a sufficient ground for its abandonment by
the Christian community; and some such suspicion simply cannot be
excluded, though it cannot be proved. But whatever we may surmise as to
what may have been in the original document, we can offer a decisive
reason why the existing conclusion should not have been part of it.
That conclusion is primarily extraneous to any gospel, and is not
originally a piece of narrative at all.</p>
<p class="par">Bernhard Weiss ascribes to Mark the original narrative
of the closing events, making Matthew a simple copyist&mdash;a matter
of no ultimate importance, seeing that it is the same impossible and
unhistorical narrative in both documents. Like all the other
professional exegetes, Bernhard Weiss and his school have failed to
discern that the document reveals not only that it is not an original
narrative at all, but that it could not possibly be a narrative.
&ldquo;It was only in the history of the passion,&rdquo; writes Weiss,
&ldquo;that Mark could give a somewhat connected account partly of what
he himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>had seen and partly of what he gathered from those
who witnessed the crucifixion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1663src" href="#xd21e1663" name="xd21e1663src">5</a> Whether
&ldquo;passion&rdquo; here includes the Agony in the Garden is not
clear: as it is expressly distinguished from the crucifixion, which
Mark by implication had not seen, the meaning remains obscure. Like the
ordinary traditionalists, Weiss assumes that &ldquo;after Peter&rsquo;s
death Mark began to note down his recollections of what the Apostle had
told him of the <i>acts and discourses</i> of Jesus.&rdquo; Supposing
this to include the record of the night of the Betrayal, what were
Mark&rsquo;s possible sources for the description of the Agony, with
its prayers, its entrances and exits, when the only disciples present
are alleged to have been asleep?</p>
<p class="par">It is the inconceivable omission of the exegetes to face
such problems that forces us finally to insist on their serious
inadequacy in this regard. They laboriously conduct an investigation up
to the point at which it leaves us, more certainly than ever, facing
the incredible, and there they leave it. Their work is done. That the
story of the Last Night was never framed as a narrative, but is
primarily a drama, which the Gospel simply transcribes, is manifest in
every section, and is definitely proved by the verses (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2014:41-42">Mk. xiv,
41&ndash;42</a>) in which, without an intervening exit, Jesus says:
&ldquo;<i>Sleep on</i> now, and take your rest.... <i>Arise</i>, let us
be going.&rdquo; The moment the document is realized to be a transcript
of a drama it becomes clear that the &ldquo;Sleep on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>now, and
take your rest&rdquo; should be inserted before the otherwise
speechless exit in verse 40, where the text says that &ldquo;they wist
not what to answer him.&rdquo; Two divergent speeches have by an
oversight in transcription been fused into one.</p>
<p class="par">That the story of the tragedy is a separate composition
has been partly perceived by critics of different schools without
drawing any elucidating inference. Wellhausen pronounces that the
Passion cannot be excepted from the verdict that Mark as a whole lacks
the character of history. &ldquo;Nothing is motived and explained by
preliminaries.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1686src" href=
"#xd21e1686" name="xd21e1686src">6</a> But &ldquo;<i>we learn as much
about the week in Jerusalem as about the year in
Galilee</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1694src" href=
"#xd21e1694" name="xd21e1694src">7</a> And the Rev. Mr. Wright gets
further, though following a wrong track:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The very fact that S. Mark devotes six chapters
out of sixteen to events which took place in the precincts of Jerusalem
makes me suspicious. Important though the passion was, <i>it seems to
be narrated at undue length. The proportions of the history are
destroyed.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1704src" href="#xd21e1704"
name="xd21e1704src">8</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Precisely. The story of the events in Jerusalem is no
proper part either of a primary document or of the first or second
Gospel. In its detail it has no congruity with the scanty and
incoherent narrative of Mark. It is of another <i>provenance</i>,
although, as Wellhausen notes, quite as unhistorical as the rest. The
non-historicity of the entire action is as plain as in the case of any
episode in the Gospels. Judas <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href=
"#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>is paid to betray a man who could
easily have been arrested without any process of betrayal; and the
conducting of the trial immediately upon the arrest, <i>throughout the
night</i>, the very witnesses being &ldquo;sought for&rdquo; in the
darkness, is plain fiction, explicable only by the dramatic obligation
to continuous action. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62"

<h2 class="main">THE ALLEGED CONSENSUS OF SCHOLARS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Such is the historical <i>impasse</i> at which
open-minded students find themselves when they would finally frame a
reasoned conception of the origin of the Christian religion. The
documentary analysis having yielded results which absolutely repel the
accepted tradition, however denuded of supernaturalism, we are driven
to seek a solution which shall be compatible with the data. And some of
us, after spending many years in shaping a sequence which should retain
the figure of the Founder and his twelve disciples, have found
ourselves forced step by step to the conclusion that these are all
alike products of myth, intelligible and explicable only as such. And
when, in absolute loyalty to all the clues, with no foregone
conclusions to support&mdash;unless the rejection of supernaturalism be
counted such&mdash;we tentatively frame for ourselves a hypothesis of a
remote origin in a sacramental cult of human sacrifice, with a probable
Jesus-<i>God</i> for its centre in Palestine, we are not surprised at
being met by the kind of explosion that has met every step in the
disintegration of traditional beliefs from Copernicus to Darwin. The
compendious Mr. Sinclair, who makes no pretension <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>to have
read any of the works setting forth the new theories, thus describes
them:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The arguments of Baconians <i>and</i> mythomaniacs
are alike made up of the merest blunders as to fact and the sheerest
misunderstanding of the meaning of facts. Grotesque
etymologies,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1743src" href="#xd21e1743"
name="xd21e1743src">1</a> arbitrary and tasteless emendations of texts,
forced parallels, unrestrained license of conjecture, the setting of
conjecture above reasonably established fact, chains of argument in
which every link is of straw, appeals to anti-theological bias and to
the miserable egotism which sees heroes with the eyes of the
valet&mdash;these are some of the formidable &ldquo;evidences&rdquo; in
deference to which we are asked to reverse the verdicts of tradition,
scholarship, and common sense. They have never imposed on anyone fairly
conversant with the facts. Those who have not such knowledge may either
simply appeal to the authority of scholars, <span class="sc">OR, BETTER
STILL, SUPPORT</span> that authority by exercizing their own
<span class="sc">IMAGINATION AND COMMON SENSE</span>.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">That tirade has seemed to me worth preserving. It is
perhaps a monition to scholars, whose function is something higher than
vituperation, to note how their inadequacies are sought to be eked out
by zeal without either scholarship or judgment, and, finally, without
intellectual sincerity. The publicist who alternately tells the unread
that they ought to accept the verdict of scholars, and that it is
&ldquo;better still&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href=
"#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>to &ldquo;support&rdquo; that verdict
by unaided &ldquo;imagination and common sense,&rdquo; has given us
once for all his moral measure.</p>
<p class="par">Dismissing him as having served his turn in illustrating
compendiously the temper which survives in Unitarian as in Trinitarian
traditionalism, we may conclude this preliminary survey with a comment
on the proposition that we should take the &ldquo;verdict of
scholars.&rdquo; It has been put by men, themselves scholars in other
fields, whom to bracket with Mr. Sinclair would be an impertinence. But
I have always been puzzled by their attitude. They proceed upon three
assumptions, which are all alike delusions. The first is that there
<i>is</i> a consensus of scholars on the details of this problem. The
second is that the professional scholars have a command of a quite
recondite knowledge as regards the central issue. The third is that
there is such a thing as professional <i>expertise</i> in the diagnosis
of Gods, Demigods, and real Founders in religious history. Once more,
the nature of the problem has not been realized.</p>
<p class="par">Let us take first the case of a real scholar in the
strictest sense of the term, Professor Gustaf Dalman, of Leipzig,
author of &ldquo;<span class="sc">The Words of Jesus</span>, considered
in the light of Post-Biblical Jewish Writings and the Aramaic
Language.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1770src" href="#xd21e1770"
name="xd21e1770src">2</a> To me, Professor Dalman appears to be an
expert of high competence, alike in Hebrew and Aramaic&mdash;a double
qualification possessed by very few of those to whose
&ldquo;verdict&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65"
name="pb65">65</a>]</span>we are told to bow. By his account few
previous experts in the same field have escaped bad miscarriages, as a
handful of excerpts will show:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">M. Friedmann, <i lang="de">Onkelos und Akylas</i>,
1896, still holds fast to the traditional opinion that even Ezra had an
Aramaic version of the Tora. In this he is mistaken.</p>
<p class="par">H. Laible, in Dalman-Laible&rsquo;s <i>Jesus Christ in
the Talmud</i>, etc., incorrectly refers it [the phrase &ldquo;bastard
of a wedded wife&rdquo;] to Jesus. The discussion treats merely of the
definition of the term &ldquo;bastard.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Adequate proof for all three parts of this assertion [A.
Neubauer&rsquo;s as to the use of Aramaic in parts of Palestine] is
awanting.</p>
<p class="par">F. Blass ... characterizes as Aramaisms idioms which in
some cases are equally good Hebraisms, and in others are pure Hebraisms
and not Aramaisms at all.</p>
<p class="par">P. W. Schmiedel ... does not succeed in reaching any
really tenable separation of Aramaisms and Hebraisms.</p>
<p class="par">Resch entirely abandons the region of what is
linguistically admissible.... And the statement of the same writer that
this ... &ldquo;belongs very specially to the epic style of narration
in the Old Testament&rdquo; is incomprehensible.</p>
<p class="par">The idioms discussed above ... show at once the
incorrectness of Schmiedel&rsquo;s contention that the narrative style
of the Gospels and the Acts is the best witness of the Greek that was
spoken among the Jews. <i>The fact is that the narrative sections of
the Synoptists have more Hebrew features than the discourses of Jesus
communicated by them.</i></p>
<p class="par">Such a book as W&uuml;nsche&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Neue
Beitr&auml;ge</i>, by reason of quite superficial and inaccurate
assertions and faulty translations, must even be characterized as
directly misleading and confusing.</p>
<p class="par">The want of due precaution in the use made of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>[the Jerusalem Targums of the Pentateuch] by J. T.
Marshall is one of the things which were bound to render his efforts to
reproduce the &ldquo;Aramaic Gospel&rdquo; a failure.</p>
<p class="par">Harnack supposes it to be an ancient Jewish conception
that &ldquo;everything of genuine value which successively appears upon
earth has its existence in heaven&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, it exists with
God&mdash;meaning in the cognition of God, and therefore really.&rdquo;
But this idea must be pronounced thoroughly un-Jewish, at all events
un-Palestinian, although the medieval Kabbala certainly harbours
notions of this sort.</p>
<p class="par">Holtzmann ... thereby evinces merely his own ignorance
of Jewish legal processes.</p>
<p class="par">Especially must his [R. H. Charles&rsquo;s] attempts at
retranslation [of the <i lang="la">Assumptio Mosis</i>] be pronounced
almost throughout a failure.</p>
<p class="par">[Even in the pertinent observations of Wellhausen and
Nestle] we feel the absence of a careful separation of Hebrew and
Aramaic possibilities.... He [Wellhausen] must be reminded that the
Jewish literature to this day is still mainly composed in Hebrew.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">These may suffice to illustrate the point. Few of the
other experts escape Dalman&rsquo;s Ithuriel spear; and as he frankly
confesses past blunders of his own, it is not to be doubted that some
of the others have returned his thrusts.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1826src" href="#xd21e1826" name="xd21e1826src">3</a> Supposing
then that this body of experts, so many of them deep in Aramaic, so
opposed to each other on so many issues clearly within the field of
their special studies, were to unite in affirming the historicity of
the Gospel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>Jesus, what would their consensus signify? Simply
that they were agreed in affirming the unknown, the improbable, and the
unprovable, while they disputed over the known. Their special studies
do not give them the slightest special authority to pronounce upon such
an issue. It is one of historic inference upon a mass of data which
they among them have made common property so far as it was not so
already, in the main documents and in previous literature. Dalman, who
takes for granted the historicity of Jesus and apparently of the
tradition in general, pronounces (p. 9) that</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">the actual discourses of Jesus in no way give the
impression that He had grown up in rural solitude and seclusion. <i>It
is true only</i> that He, like the Galileans generally in that region,
<i>would have</i> little contact with literary erudition.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">If Professor Dalman cannot see that the proposition in
the first sentence is extremely disturbing to the traditional belief in
its Unitarian form, and that the second is a mere <i lang="la">petitio
principii</i> which cannot save the situation, other people can see it.
His scholarship gives him no &ldquo;eminent domain&rdquo; over logic;
and it does not require a knowledge of Aramaic to detect the weakness
of his reasoning. Fifty experts in Aramaic carry no weight for a
thinking man on such a non-linguistic issue; and he who defers to them
as if they did is but throwing away his birthright. When again Dalman
writes (p. 60) that &ldquo;Peter <i>must</i> have appeared (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010:24">Acts x,
24</a>) from a very early date as a preacher in the Greek
language,&rdquo; he again raises an insoluble problem for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>the
traditionalists of all schools, and his scholarly status is quite
irrelevant to that.</p>
<p class="par">When, yet again, he writes (p. 71) that &ldquo;what is
firmly established is only the <i>fact</i> that Jesus spoke in Aramaic
to the Jews,&rdquo; his mastery of Aramaic has nothing to do with the
case. He is merely taking for granted the historicity of the main
tradition; and until he faces the problems he has ignored (having, as
he may fairly claim, been occupied with others), and repelled the
criticisms which that tradition incurs, his vote on the unconsidered
issue has no more value to a rational judgment than any other. I have
seldom read a scholarly treatise more satisfying than his within its
special field, or more provocative of astonishment at the extent to
which specialism can close men&rsquo;s eyes to the problems which
overlap or underlie theirs.</p>
<p class="par">And <i>that</i> is the consideration that has to be
realized by those who talk of scholarship (meaning simply what is
called New Testament scholarship) settling a historical problem which
turns upon anthropology, mythology, hierology, psychology, and literary
and historical science in general. On these sides the scholars in
question, &ldquo;<i lang="de">Wir Gelehrten vom Fach</i>,&rdquo; as the
German specialists call themselves in the German manner, are not
experts at all, not even amateurs, inasmuch as they have never even
realized that those other sciences are involved. They have fallen into
the <i lang="fr">r&ocirc;le</i> of the pedant, properly so-called, who
presumes to regulate life by inapplicable knowledge. And even those who
are wholly free of this presumptuous pedantry, the sober, courteous,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>and sane scholars like Professor Schmiedel, whose
candour enables him to contribute a preface to such a book as Professor
W. B. Smith&rsquo;s <span class="sc" lang="de">Der vorchristliche
Jesus</span>, to whose thesis he does not assent&mdash;even these, as
we have seen, can fail to realize the scope of the problem to the
discussion of which they have contributed.</p>
<p class="par">Professor Schmiedel&rsquo;s careful argument from
&ldquo;derogatory&rdquo; episodes in the gospel of Mark, be it
repeated, is not merely inconclusive; it elicits a rebuttal which turns
it into a defeat. Inadequate even on the textual side, it is wholly
fallacious on the hierological and the mythological; and no more than
the ordinary conservative polemic does it recognize the sociological
problem involved. For those who seek to study history comprehensively
and comprehendingly, the residuum of the conservative case is a blank
incredibility. Even Dalman, after the closest linguistic and literary
analysis, has left the meaning of &ldquo;the Kingdom of God&rdquo; a
conundrum;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1883src" href="#xd21e1883" name=
"xd21e1883src">4</a> and the conservative case finally consists in
asserting that Christianity as a public movement arose in the simple
<i>announcement</i> of that conundrum&mdash;the mere utterance of the
formula&mdash;throughout Palestine by a body of twelve apostles, who
for the rest &ldquo;cast out devils,&rdquo; as instructed by their
Teacher. The &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; which contentedly rests facing
that vacuous conception is a scholarship not qualified finally to
handle a great historical problem as such. It conducts itself
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>exactly as did Biblical scholarship so long in
face of the revelations of geology, and as did Hebrew scholarship so
long over the problem of the Tabernacle in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="par">Deeply learned men, in the latter case, went on for
generations solemnly re-writing history in the terms of the re-arranged
documents, when all the while the history was historic
myth&mdash;perceptible as such to a Zulu who <i>had</i> lived in a
desert. And when the Zulu&rsquo;s teacher proved the case by simple
arithmetic, he met at the hands alike of pedants and of pietists a
volley of malignant vituperation, the &ldquo;religious&rdquo; expert
Maurice excelling many of the most orthodox in the virulence of his
scorn; while the pontifical Arnold, from the Olympian height of his
amateurism, severely lectured Colenso for not having written in
Latin.</p>
<p class="par">Until the scholars and the amateurs alike renounce their
own presumption, their thrice stultified airs of finality, their
estimate of their prejudice and their personal equation as a revelation
from within, and their sacerdotal conviction that their science is
<i>the</i> science of every case, they will have to be unkindly
reminded that they are but blunderers like other men, that in their own
specialties they convict each other of errors without number, and that
the only path to truth is that of the eternal free play and clash of
all manner of criticism. It is an exceptionally candid orthodox scholar
who writes: &ldquo;It is a law of the human mind that combating error
is the best way to advance knowledge. They who have never joined in
controversy have no firm grasp of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71"
href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>truth. Hateful and unchristian
as theological disputes are apt to become, they have this merit, that
they open our eyes.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1907src" href=
"#xd21e1907" name="xd21e1907src">5</a> Let the conservative disputants
then be content to put their theses and their arguments like other men,
to meet argument with argument when they can, and to hold their peace
when they have nothing better to add than boasts and declamation.</p>
<p class="par">Before the end of the nineteenth century the very school
which we are asked to regard as endowed with quasi-papal powers in
matters of historical criticism was declared by one of its leading
representatives in Germany to have been on a wrong track for fifty
years. In the words of Professor Blass:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Professor Harnack, in his most recent publication,
even while stating that now the tide has turned, and that theology,
after having strayed in the darkness and led others into darkness (see
<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2015:14">Matt.
xv, 14</a>) for about fifty years, has now got a better insight into
things, and has come to a truer appreciation of the real
trustworthiness of tradition, still puts Mark&rsquo;s gospel between 65
and 70 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, Matthew&rsquo;s between 70 and 75,
but Luke&rsquo;s much later, about 78&ndash;93.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1924src" href="#xd21e1924" name="xd21e1924src">6</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">And Blass, who dates Luke 56 or 60, goes on:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Has that confessedly untrustworthy guide of
laymen, scientific theology, after so many errors committed during
fifty years, now of a sudden become a trustworthy one? Or have we good
reason to mistrust it as much, or even more than we had before? <i>In
ordinary life no sane person would follow a guide who confessed to
having grossly misled him during the whole former part of the journey.
Evidently that guide was either utterly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>ignorant of the way</i>,
or he had some views and aims of his own, of which the traveller was
unaware, and he cannot be assumed now to have acquired a full
knowledge, or to have laid those views and aims wholly aside.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Thus does one <i lang="de">Gelehrter vom Fach</i>
estimate the pretensions of a whole sanhedrim of another <i lang=
"de">Fach</i>. Blass is a philologist; and incidentally we have seen
how another philologist, Dalman, handles him in that capacity.
Elsewhere, after another fling at the theological scholars&mdash;with a
salvo of praise to Harnack for his <span class="sc" lang="de">Lukas der
Arzt</span>&mdash;and a comment on the fashion in which every German
critic swears by his master, he avows that &ldquo;we classical
philologists ... have seen similar follies among ourselves in fair
number.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1952src" href="#xd21e1952"
name="xd21e1952src">7</a> It is most true; and the philologists are as
much divided as the theologians.</p>
<p class="par">Of course, it is not by philology that Blass has reached
the standpoint from which he can contemn the professional theologians.
He is really on the same ground as they, making the same primary
assumptions of historicity: the only difference is that while they,
following the same historical tradition, yet scruple to accept
prophecies as having been actually made at the time assigned to them,
and feel bound to date the prophecy after the event, the consistent
philologist recognizes no such obligation in the present instance, and
puts a rather adroit but very unscholarly argument on the subject, with
which we shall have to deal later. But for those to whom the exact
dating of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>Gospels is a subsidiary problem, his argument has
only a subsidiary interest; and the fact that he unquestioningly agrees
with his flouted theological colleagues in accepting the historicity of
Jesus gives no importance to their consensus.</p>
<p class="par">If, as he says, they are in the mass utterly
untrustworthy guides on <i>any</i> historical issue (an extravagance to
which, as a layman, I do not subscribe), their agreement can be of no
value to him where he and they coincide. After telling Harnack that men
who have confessedly been astray for fifty years have no right to
expect to be listened to, he makes much of Harnack&rsquo;s support as
to the historicity of the Acts&mdash;a course which will not impose
upon thoughtful readers. All the while, of course, Professor Blass is
simply applying a revised historical criticism to a single issue or set
of issues, and even if he chance to be right on these he has set up no
new historical method. No more than the others has he recognized the
central historical problem; and he must be well aware that that
reversion to tradition announced by Harnack, and at this point
acquiesced in by him, cannot for a moment be maintained as a general
critical principle in regard to the New Testament any more than in
regard to the Old. All that he can claim is that many theologians have
confessedly blundered seriously on historical problems. But that is
quite enough to justify us in admonishing the mere middlemen and the
experts alike to change the tone of absurd assurance with which they
meet further innovations of historical theory. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is only just to confess that the conservatives
are already learning to employ some prudential expedients. Met by the
challenge to their own nakedly untenable positions, and offered a
constructive hypothesis, diversely elaborated from various quarters,
they mostly evade the discussion at nearly every point where the
impossible tradition is concretely confronted by a thinkable
substitute, and spend themselves over the remoter issues of universal
mythology. Habitually misrepresenting every argument from comparative
mythology as an assertion of a historical sequence in the compared
data, they expatiate over questions of etymology, and are loud in their
outcry over a suggestion that a given historical sequence may be
surmised from data more or less obscure. But to the question how the
evangel could possibly have begun as the record represents, or how the
consummation could possibly have taken place as described, they either
attempt no answer whatever or offer answers which are worse than
evasions. One professional disputant, dealing with the proposition that
such a judicial and police procedure as the systematic search for
witnesses described in the Gospel story of the Trial <i>could not</i>
take place by night, &ldquo;when an Eastern <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>city is
as a city of the dead,&rdquo; did not scruple to say that the thesis
amounted to saying that in an Eastern city nothing could happen by
night. This controversialist is an instructor of youth, and claims to
be an instructed scholar. And his is the only answer that I have seen
to the challenge with which it professes to deal. Loisy agrees that the
challenge cannot be met.</p>
<p class="par">To the hypothesis that there was a pre-Christian cult of
a Jesus-God, the traditionalist&mdash;above all, the Unitarian, who
seems to feel the pinch here most acutely&mdash;retorts with a volley
of indignant contempt. <i>He</i> can see no sign of any such cult. In
the mind&rsquo;s eye he can see, as a historic process, twelve Apostles
creating a Christian community by simply crying aloud that the Kingdom
of Heaven is at hand, excommunicating for the after life those who will
not listen, and all the while assiduously casting out devils. His
records baldly tell him that this happened; and &ldquo;we believe in
baptism because we have seen it done.&rdquo; But whereas, in the nature
of the case, the reconstruction of the real historic process must be by
tentative inference from a variety of data which for the most part the
records as a matter of course obscured, he makes loud play with the
simple fact that the records lack the required clear mention, and
brands as &ldquo;unsupported conjecture&rdquo; the theorem offered in
place of the plain untruth with which he has so long been
satisfied.</p>
<p class="par">In his own sifted and &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; records we
have the narration of the carrying of the Divine <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>Man to a
height (&ldquo;pinnacle of the temple&rdquo; <i>only</i> in the
supposed primitive Gospel) by Satan for purposes of temptation. For a
mythologist this myth easily falls into line as a variant of the series
of Pan and the young Zeus at the altar on the mountain top, Pan and
Apollo competing on the top of Mount Tmolus, Apollo and Marsyas, all
deriving from the Babylonian figures of the Goat-God (Capricorn) and
the Sun-God on the Mountain of the World, representing the starting of
the sun on his yearly course. That assignment explains at once the
Pagan myths and the Christian, which is thus shown to have borrowed
from the myth material of the Greco-Oriental world in an early
documentary stage. Challenged to evade that solution, he mentions only
the Pan-Zeus story, says nothing of the series of variants or of the
Babylonian original, and replies that he is</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">unable to trace any real and fundamental
connection between the stories. In the Buddhist narrative [which had
been cited as an analogue<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1996src" href=
"#xd21e1996" name="xd21e1996src">1</a>] the &ldquo;temptation&rdquo; to
satisfy the cravings of hunger, the promptings of ambition, and the
doubts as to the overruling Providence of God, are all wanting. In the
Roman story, too, Pan, as representing in satyr-form the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>lower
and animal propensities of man, <i>is a very different being to the
Hebrew Satan</i>; moreover, there is no tempting of Jupiter, as there
is of Jesus. Jupiter, likewise, is wholly a god; <i>Jesus is a sorely
bested Man, although divine</i>. There is, in short, not the least
affinity between any of these narratives beyond the general idea of
trial.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2010src" href="#xd21e2010" name=
"xd21e2010src">2</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">And this figures as a refutation. For our
traditionalist, comparative mythology does not and cannot exist; for
him there can be no fundamental connection between any two nominal
myths unless they are absolutely identical in all their details; and
the goat-footed Pan and the goat-footed Satan (certainly descended from
the Goat-God Azazel) are merely &ldquo;very different beings,&rdquo;
though Satan for the later Jews and Jesuists actually corresponded to
Pan (who is <i>not</i> a mere satyr for the Greeks) not only in being
the spirit of concupiscence<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2021src" href=
"#xd21e2021" name="xd21e2021src">3</a> but in being &ldquo;the God of
this world,&rdquo; as the Gospel myth in effect shows him to be. And
this exhibition of ignorance of every principle of mythology passes for
&ldquo;scholarship,&rdquo; and will be duly so certificated by Sir
William Robertson Nicoll, who undertakes to preside in that department,
as in politics, with about equal qualifications.</p>
<p class="par">By way of constructive solution of the problem we have
from the apologist this:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">If a conjecture may be hazarded here, we should be
inclined to say that the Christian narrative <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>largely
presents, in picturesque and symbolic form, the subjective experiences
and doubts of Jesus&mdash;<i>whether</i> these were of internal origin
merely, or were suggested externally by <i>some</i> malignant spiritual
being&mdash;as to His capacities and power for the great work which He
had undertaken.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The thoroughly orthodox, it would appear, must still be
catered for, albeit only by the concession of the possibility of
&ldquo;some&rdquo; malignant spiritual being, which seems a gratuitous
slight to the canonical Satan, whose moral dignity had immediately
before been acclaimed. But, after expressly insisting on the elements
of &ldquo;temptation&rdquo; and &ldquo;ambition&rdquo; in the story,
with the apparent implication that the young Teacher may have had a
passing ambition to become a world conqueror, our exegete, in
conclusion, collapses to the position of the German exegetes who, the
other day, were still debating on the spiritual interpretation of what
they could not perceive to be a pure myth of art.</p>
<p class="par">At this stage of enlightenment we hear allusions to
&ldquo;psychology,&rdquo; though I have not yet met with any explicit
pretence that the traditionalist scholars know anything about
psychology that is not known to the rest of us. In any case, the
suggestion may be hazarded that the first researches they make into
psychology might usefully be directed to their own, which is a
distressing illustration of the survival of the intellectual methods of
the ancient apologists for the Vedas and for the mythology of the
Greeks.</p>
<p class="par">A severe scrutiny of psychic processes is indeed highly
necessary in this as in so many other disputes in which the affections
wrestle with the reason. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href=
"#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>Such a process of analysis gives us
the real causation of the testimony borne by Mill, which is so widely
typical. For non-religious as for religious minds the conception they
form of the Gospel Jesus is commonly a resultant of a few dominant
impressions, varying in each case but all cognate. Jesus is figured
first to the recipient spirit as a blessed babe in the arms of an
idealized mother, and last as dying on the cross, cruelly tortured for
no crime&mdash;the supreme example of the martyred philanthropist. In
the interim he figures as commanding his dull disciples to
&ldquo;Suffer little children to come unto me,&rdquo; and as
&ldquo;going about doing good,&rdquo; all the while preaching
forgiveness and brotherly love. No knowledge of the impossibility of
most of the particularized cures will withhold even instructed men from
soothing their sensibilities by crediting the favourite figure with
some vague &ldquo;healing power&rdquo; and talking of the possibilities
of &ldquo;faith healing,&rdquo; even as they loosely accredit some
elevating quality, some practical purport, to the visionary evangel, so
absolutely mythical that the Gospel writers can tell us not a word of
its matter.</p>
<p class="par">Even Professor Schmiedel, expressly applying the tests
of naturalism, negates those tests at the outset by taking for granted
the Teacher&rsquo;s possession of unquantified &ldquo;psychic&rdquo;
healing powers, though the narratives twenty times tell of cures which
cannot possibly be described as cases of faith-healing.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2054src" href="#xd21e2054" name="xd21e2054src">4</a>
If for the sane inquirer the absolute <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>miracle stories are
false, and <i>these</i> stories are false, by what right does he allot
evidential value to wholesale allegations of multitudinous cures from
the same sources? By the sole right of his predilections. The measure
which he metes to the thousand prodigies in Livy is never meted to
those of the Gospels. For him, these are different things, being seen
in another atmosphere.</p>
<p class="par">In men concerned to be intellectually law-abiding, these
dialectic divagations are decently veiled; by others they are
passionately flaunted. No recollection of the anger of Plato at those
who denied that the Sun and Planets were divine and blessed beings can
withhold certain professed scholars from the same angry folly in a
similar predicament. But even where theological animus has been in a
manner disciplined by the long professional battle over documentary
problems, the sheer lack of logical challenge on fundamental issues has
left all the disputants alike, down till the other day, taking for
granted data to which they had no critical right.</p>
<p class="par">Throughout the whole debate, even in the case of
scholars who profess to be loyal to induction, we find that there is a
presupposition upon which induction has no effect. Bernhard Weiss,
quoting from Holtzmann the profoundly subversive proposition that
&ldquo;Christianity has been &lsquo;book-learning&rsquo; from the
beginning,&rdquo; in reply &ldquo;can only say, God <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>be
praised that it is not so.&rdquo; Yet the real effect of his own
research is to show us much&mdash;to show that there was no oral
evangel, that the formula of &ldquo;the kingdom of heaven&rdquo; is but
a phrase to fill a blank. Even candid inquirers who see the difficulty,
like Samuel Davidson, leave it unsolved. Says Davidson:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">When we try to form a correct view of
Jesus&rsquo;s utterances regarding this Kingdom of God, we find they
have much vagueness and ambiguity. Their differences also in the
Synoptic Gospels and the fourth are so apparent that the latter must be
left out of account in any attempt to get a proper sketch of
Jesus&rsquo;s hopes. His apostles and other early reporters
misunderstood some of His sayings, making them crasser. Oral tradition
marred their original form. This is specially the case with respect to
the enthusiastic hopes about the kingdom He looked for. But as the
ideal did not become actual we must rest in the great fact that the
Christianity He introduced was the nucleus of a perfect system adapted
to universal humanity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2080src" href=

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We must&rdquo; do no such thing. We
&ldquo;must&rdquo; draw a licit inference. The alleged great fact is
morally a chimera, and historically a hallucination. To admit that all
the evidence collapses, and then to posit the visionary gospel with a
&ldquo;must,&rdquo; is to abandon critical principle. The
&ldquo;must&rdquo; is simply the eternal presupposition. And the choice
of the sincere student &ldquo;must&rdquo; be between that negation of
science and a fresh scientific search, from which the presupposition,
as such, is excluded. If it can reappear as a licit conclusion, so be
it. But it has never yet so arisen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82"

<h2 class="main">BLASS AND FLINDERS PETRIE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A very interesting attempt to bring the synoptic
problem to a new critical test has latterly been made by Dr. Flinders
Petrie in his work, <span class="sc">The Growth of the Gospels as shown
by Structural Criticism</span> (1910). His starting point is the
likelihood that <i>logia</i>, analogous to the non-canonical fragments
discovered in recent years, were the original material from which the
Gospels were built up. The hypothesis is <i>prima facie</i> quite
legitimate, there being nothing to repel it. As he contends, there is
now evidence that writing was in much more common use in some periods
of antiquity than scholars had formerly supposed; and scraps of writing
by non-scholarly persons, he argues, may have been widely current in
the environment with which we are concerned. All the while he is
founding on data from the Egypt of the third century for a Palestinian
environment of the first; and he is obliged to stress the point that
Matthew the tax-gatherer was a &ldquo;professional scribe,&rdquo; while
his argument runs that Matthew used the detached jottings of other
people, not his own. But let us follow out his thesis:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">We <i>cannot doubt</i> [writes Dr. Petrie] that
such was the course of growth when we look at the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span><i>logia</i>. Those collections of brief sayings
could hardly have come into existence if full narratives and sufficient
standards of information in the Gospels were already circulating. They
belong essentially to a preparatory age, when records were in course of
compilation. But, once written out, they naturally survived side by
side with the Gospels, which had only used a portion of their
material.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2116src" href="#xd21e2116" name=
"xd21e2116src">1</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">It is not quite clear whether Dr. Petrie meant here to
claim not only that the so-called <span class="sc">Logia Iesou</span>
published in 1897 and 1904 are anterior to and independent of the
Gospels (though found only in third-century MSS.), but that they are on
the same footing of credibility with the Gospels. This, however, seems
inevitably to follow from his position, though it appears to suggest to
him no difficulty about the general historicity of the Gospel story,
which he too takes for granted. Let us then note the problems
raised.</p>
<p class="par">A main feature of Dr. Petrie&rsquo;s inquiry is that,
following Professor Blass, he insists on making the predictions of the
fall of Jerusalem part of the early documentary matter collected in the
&ldquo;Nucleus&rdquo; which for him is the equivalent of Weiss&rsquo;s
Primitive Gospel. The argument of Blass<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2126src" href="#xd21e2126" name="xd21e2126src">2</a> is drawn
from the case of Savonarola, who in 1496 predicted that Rome would be
sacked, and that horses would be stabled in the churches, as actually
happened in the year 1527. If such a prophecy could be made and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>fulfilled in one case, urges Blass, it might be in
another; hence there can be no rigorous application of the canon,
<i lang="la">Omne vaticinium post eventum</i>, which has been relied on
by the modern school of critical theologians. Dr. Petrie appears to
have made no investigation of his own, being content to quote and
support Blass; and the point is well worth critical consideration.</p>
<p class="par">Let us premise that scientific criticism, which has no
concern with Unitarian predilections, stands quite impartially towards
the question of Gospel dates. The modern tendency to carry down those
dates, either for the whole or for any parts of the Gospels, towards or
into the second century, is originally part of the general
&ldquo;liberal&rdquo; inclination to put a Man in place of a God,
though some believers in the God acquiesce as to the lateness of the
act of writing. Those who have carried on the movement have always
presupposed the general historicity of the Teacher, and have been
concerned, however unconsciously, to find a historical solution which
saved that presupposition. The rational critic, making only the
naturalist presupposition, is committed to no set of documentary dates.
And he is not at all committed to the denial that an inductive historic
prediction, as distinguished from a supernaturalist prophecy, may be
made and fulfilled. Many have been. Much has been said of the
&ldquo;marvellous prescience&rdquo; of Burke in predicting that the
anarchy of the French Revolution would end in a tyranny. He was in fact
merely inferring, as he well might, that what had happened in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>history of ancient Rome and in the history of
England would happen in France. By a similar historical method several
French and other writers in the eighteenth century reached the forecast
of the revolt of the American colonies from Britain without getting any
credit for divine inspiration. And so, perhaps, might Savonarola at the
end of the fifteenth century predict a sack of Rome, and a Jew in the
first century a sack of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="par">But let us see what Savonarola actually did. He was, so
to speak, a professional prophet, and while he predicted not only a
sack of Rome but his own death by violence, he also, by the admission
of sympathetic biographers, put forth many vaticinations of an entirely
fantastic character. Here again he might very well have a Jewish
prototype. For us the first question is, What did he actually predict
in history, and how and why did he predict it? In 1494 he seems to have
predicted the French invasion which took place in that year. Villari
asserts that he did so in the sermons he preached in Lent, but admits
that &ldquo;it is impossible to ascertain the precise nature&rdquo; of
the sermons in question.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2152src" href=
"#xd21e2152" name="xd21e2152src">3</a> Father Lucas goes further, and
points out that there is no trace in them of the alleged
prophecy<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2158src" href="#xd21e2158" name=
"xd21e2158src">4</a> which Savonarola in his <i lang="la">Compendium
Revelationum</i> (1495) claims to have made but does not date. Villari
further admits that the sermons of that year are so badly reported
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">as to have lost almost every characteristic of
Savonarola&rsquo;s style. Their reporter, unable to keep pace with the
preacher&rsquo;s words, only jotted down rough and fragmentary notes.
These were afterwards translated into barbarous dog-Latin&mdash;by way
of giving them a more literary form&mdash;and published in Venice. For
this reason Qu&eacute;tif and some other writers entertained doubts of
their authenticity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2171src" href=
"#xd21e2171" name="xd21e2171src">5</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Villari nevertheless is satisfied of it on internal
grounds, and we may accept his estimate. The main allegation is that in
1494 Savonarola, who had for years been preaching that national sin
would elicit divine chastisement,</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">in those Lenten discourses, <i>and also in some
others</i>, foretold the coming of a new Cyrus, who would march through
Italy in triumph, without encountering any obstacles, and without
breaking a single lance. We find numerous records of these predictions,
and the terrors excited by them, in the historians and biographers of
the period; and Fra Benedetto reports his master&rsquo;s words in the
following verses [thus literally translated]:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Soon</i> shalt thou see each tyrant overthrown,</p>
<p class="line">And all Italy shalt thou see vanquished,</p>
<p class="line">To her shame, disgrace, and harm.</p>
<p class="line">Thou, Rome, shalt soon be captured:</p>
<p class="line">I see the blade of wrath come upon thee;</p>
<p class="line">The time is short, each day flies past:</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">My Lord will <i>renovate the Church,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>And convert every barbarian people.</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>There will be but one fold and one shepherd.</i></p>
<p class="line">But first Italy will have to mourn,</p>
<p class="line">And so much of her blood will be shed</p>
<p class="line">That her people shall everywhere be thinned.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Here there is obvious confusion, apart from the fact
that the predicted regeneration and unification of the church never
took place. The invader is to do no fighting, and yet so much blood
will be shed that everywhere the people of Italy will be thinned. Are
we, then, to believe that the &ldquo;Cyrus&rdquo; prediction was made
at the same time? Is there not ground for suspicion that it was
interpolated <i lang="la">post eventum</i>, in the Latin report? The
only alternative solution seems to be that Villari or the Italian
compiler has mixed prophecies of different years. In his sermon of
November 1, 1494, Savonarola speaks of the French invasion as the
&ldquo;scourge&rdquo; he had predicted<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2227src" href="#xd21e2227" name="xd21e2227src">6</a>&mdash;an odd
way of speaking of one promised before as &ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s
anointed,&rdquo; even though the French host is said to be &ldquo;led
by the Lord.&rdquo; In any case his own claim to have predicted of
&ldquo;Cyrus&rdquo; is unsupported by evidence, and, even if accepted,
does not involve a date earlier than 1493&ndash;4.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2230src" href="#xd21e2230" name="xd21e2230src">7</a></p>
<p class="par">To predict the invasion of Italy by Charles VIII of
France in Lent of 1494, or even late in 1493, was easy enough.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2235src" href="#xd21e2235" name="xd21e2235src">8</a>
The invasion had been fully prepared, and was expected, even as was the
Armada in the England of 1588. Savonarola was very likely to have
inside knowledge of the scheme, and the Pope positively charged him
with having helped to engineer it. Florence in effect received
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>Charles as a friend. There had been, further,
abundant discussion of the expedition both in France and Italy long
before it set out. Guicciardini tells that wise Frenchmen were very
apprehensive about it, and that Ferdinand of Naples reckoned that it
must fail. Fail it finally did. Savonarola might even predict that the
invader would not be resisted, for there was no force ready in Italy to
repel that led by Charles, with its great train of artillery. It is an
extreme oversight of Villari&rsquo;s to allege<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2240src" href="#xd21e2240" name="xd21e2240src">9</a> that in the
autumn, &ldquo;unexpectedly as a thunderclap from a clear sky, came the
news that a flood of foreign soldiery was pouring down from the Alps to
the conquest of Italy.... All felt taken unawares.&rdquo; This
assertion is completely exploded by the record of Guicciardini, and no
historian will now endorse it. Lodovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, had
incited Charles to the invasion; the preparations had been open and
extensive; and they had been abundantly discussed both in France and
Italy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2243src" href="#xd21e2243" name=
"xd21e2243src">10</a> The statement that &ldquo;the Friar alone had
foreseen the future&rdquo; is absolute myth.</p>
<p class="par">The fact remains that the invasion was not resisted, and
that Rome was &ldquo;captured&rdquo; in the sense of being entered by
Charles, who did no military damage and marched out again. But when
Charles proceeded to withdraw from Italy, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>having effected nothing,
a battle was fought and won by him. It was two years later that
Savonarola, acting on his standing doctrine that sin in high places
must elicit divine vengeance, resumed his predictions of disaster to
Rome, whose Pope was his enemy. As it happened, 1496 was again a year
of expected invasions. Charles, now the ally of Florence, was announced
to be preparing for a second inroad, and the apprehensive Sforza
invited and furthered the intervention of the emperor Maximilian as he
had before invited Charles. Predictions were again to be expected; at
Bologna at least one was actually made; and the prophet, one Raffaele
da Firenzuola, was tortured and banished.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2253src" href="#xd21e2253" name="xd21e2253src">11</a> Charles
gave up his plan, but Maximilian came, albeit with a small force, and
was welcomed by the Pisans.</p>
<p class="par">It was before the coming of Maximilian<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2262src" href="#xd21e2262" name="xd21e2262src">12</a> that
Savonarola resumed his prophecy of the coming scourge in a series of
sermons, in one of which he announces that Italy will be overwhelmed
because she is full of sanguinary deeds; that Rome will be besieged and
trampled down; and that because her churches have been full of harlots
they will be made &ldquo;stables for horses and swine, the which will
be less displeasing to God than seeing them made haunts of
prostitutes.... Then, O Italy, trouble after <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>trouble
shall befall thee; troubles of war after famine, troubles of pestilence
after war.&rdquo; Again, in another sermon: &ldquo;There will not be
enough men left to bury the dead; nor means enough to dig graves....
The dead will be heaped in carts and on horses; they will be piled up
and burnt.... And the people shall be so thinned that few shall
remain.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2270src" href="#xd21e2270"
name="xd21e2270src">13</a> At the same time he repeatedly predicted his
own death by violence.</p>
<p class="par">On the latter head he had abundant reason for his
forecast. On the former it is very certain that he was not thinking of
something that was not to happen for thirty years. Again and again he
assured his hearers and his correspondents that his predictions were to
be fulfilled &ldquo;in our time.&rdquo; Towards the end of 1496 he
described himself as &ldquo;The servant of Christ Jesus, sent by him to
the city of Florence to announce the great scourge which is to come
upon Italy, and especially upon Rome, <i>and which is to extend itself
over all the world in our days and quickly</i>.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2287src" href="#xd21e2287" name=
"xd21e2287src">14</a> In 1497, in a letter to Lodovico Pittorio,
chancellor to d&rsquo;Este, after speaking of the Lord&rsquo;s
prediction of the fall of Jerusalem, he writes: &ldquo;Great
tribulations are always [<i>i.e.</i> in the Scriptures] predicted many
years before they come. Yet I do not say that the tribulations which I
have foretold will be so long in coming; <i>nay, they will come soon;
indeed I say that the tribulation has already
commenced</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2299src" href=
"#xd21e2299" name="xd21e2299src">15</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Yet again, in 1498, he claims in a sermon that &ldquo;a
part has come to pass,&rdquo; noting that &ldquo;in Rome one has lost a
son&rdquo;&mdash;a reference to the murder of the Duke of Gandia, son
of the Pope; and adding that &ldquo;you have seen who has died here,
and I could tell you, an I would, who is in hell&rdquo;&mdash;supposed
to be a reference to Bernardo del Nero.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2308src" href="#xd21e2308" name="xd21e2308src">16</a> All this
was in terms of Savonarola&rsquo;s theological and Biblical conception
of things, the ruling political philosophy of his age, as of many
before. Wickedness and injustice, fraud and oppression, were dominant
in high places, and God must of necessity punish, in the fashion in
which he was constantly described as doing so in the Sacred Books, from
the Deluge downwards. In Savonarola&rsquo;s view the cup of
Rome&rsquo;s abominations was full, and punishment had been earned by
the men then living, in particular by Pope Alexander.</p>
<p class="par">Within two years Savonarola had been put to death, after
many tortures; and Alexander died in 1503 (not by poison, as the
tradition goes) without having seen the predicted desolation. It was
under the more respectable of the two Medicean Popes that Rome was
twice sacked in 1527 by the forces of Charles V; and though there had
been infinite slaughter and pestilence in Italy, the regeneration and
reunion of Christendom predicted by Savonarola did not follow. When no
reform whatever had followed on the French invasion he had explained
that his prediction in that case was subject to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>conditions. Yet he announced that his prophecy of
the conversion of the Turks was unconditional, declaring at the close
of the <i lang="la">Compendium Revelationum</i> that it would be
fulfilled in fifteen years, and assuring his hearers in 1495 that some
of them would live to see the fulfilment.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par first">Our business, of course, is not to expose the
prophetic miscarriages of Savonarola, but simply to make clear what
manner of thing his prophesying was.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2333src" href="#xd21e2333" name="xd21e2333src">1</a> It was an
instance of a kind of vaticination as old as Troy and Jerusalem, which

"xd21e2336src">2</a> The wars and plagues and famines were very safe
prognostications: they came in every decade. And when we come to his
alleged prediction of the sack of Rome we realize immediately, not only
that the one detail of coincidence is wholly fortuitous, but that, like
his predecessors, he was simply predicting a return of common evils
already experienced a hundred times.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">The argument of Blass and others on this topic,
confidently accepted and endorsed by Dr. Petrie, works out as sheer
mystification. They lay special <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94"
href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>stress on the fact that in the
sack of 1527 horses were stabled in the churches. It is likely enough:
the same thing has been done a thousand times in the wars of
Christendom. But the argument has been very negligently conducted. In
the first place, though he tells of infinitely worse things, such as
the wholesale violation of women, including nuns, the historian
Guicciardini does not give the detail about the horses. That occurs in
the document <i lang="it">Il Sacco di Roma</i>, ascribed latterly to
his brother Luigi, which was first printed <i>in 1664</i>. Still, let
us assume that the printing was faithful. If an interpolator had meant
to vindicate Savonarola he would presumably have noted that the prophet
specified not only horses but pigs, whereas the narrative says nothing
of the latter. We are thus left with the item of the stabling of horses
in the churches.</p>
<p class="par">Here we have to note that as regards the main event
Savonarola is predicting a thing that had repeatedly happened in
Catholic times, and that as regards the minor details he is speaking
with his eye on Jewish history. It was not the mere presence of horses
and pigs in churches that he meant to stress, but the defilement that
they brought. In the case of the Jewish Temple the &ldquo;abomination
of desolation&rdquo; had been understood to include the defiling of the
altar with swine&rsquo;s flesh.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2357src"
href="#xd21e2357" name="xd21e2357src">4</a> This, in all likelihood,
was the origin of Savonarola&rsquo;s prediction as to the bringing of
pigs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>into the sanctuary at Rome, which, as we have
seen, was not fulfilled.</p>
<p class="par">But there was nothing new about a Catholic sack of Rome.
The city had been hideously sacked and in large part destroyed under
Gregory VII (1084) by Robert Guiscard, <i>the Pope&rsquo;s ally</i>,
after having been captured without sacking by the German Emperor. It
just missed being sacked by Frederick II in 1239. In 1413 it was
captured by Ladislaus of Naples, who gave all Florentine property in
the city to pillage. No question of heresy arose in these episodes; nor
did the forces of the Church itself blench at either sack or sacrilege.
Faenza was foully sacked in 1376 by Hawkwood, called in for its defence
by the bishop of Ostia; and in 1377 the same <i>condottiere</i>
massacred the population of Cesena under the express and continuous
orders of Robert, Cardinal of Geneva, the papal legate, afterwards the
&ldquo;anti-pope&rdquo; Clement VII. No more bestial massacre took
place in the pandemonium of the fourteenth century; and the sacking of
the churches and the violation of the nuns was on the scale of the
bloodshed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2370src" href="#xd21e2370" name=
"xd21e2370src">5</a> In view of the endless atrocities of the wars of
the Church and of Christendom there is a certain ripe absurdity about
the exegetical comments on the subject of the sack of Rome in 1527.
Says Blass:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Especially remarkable is this, that he
[Savonarola] extends the devastation to the churches of Rome, which in
any <i>ordinary capture</i> (!) by a Catholic army would have been
spared, but in this case were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>not at all respected, because a great
part of the conquering army consisted of German Lutherans, for whom the
Roman Catholic churches were rather objects of hatred and contempt than
of veneration. Now Lutheranism did not exist in 1496.<a class="noteref"

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">And Dr. Petrie adds: &ldquo;Such a detail seemed
excessively unlikely before the rise of Lutheranism; yet it came to
pass.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2391src" href="#xd21e2391"
name="xd21e2391src">7</a> It is interesting to realize the notions held
by scholars of such standing in regard to European history after a
century signalized by so much historic research; and to find that such
an ignorant proposition as that just cited should for Dr. Petrie
&ldquo;explode the dogma&rdquo; that really fulfilled

<p class="par">For centuries before Luther the desecration of churches
was a regular feature in every Christian war of any extent. It is
arguable, perhaps, that in the sack of Rome the German troops might
have made a special display of that mania for ordure as an instrument
of war of which we have had such circumstantial accounts from Belgium
of late, and of which similar details have been preserved in the
domestic history of Paris since 1870.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2404src" href="#xd21e2404" name="xd21e2404src">9</a> But the
stabling of horses in churches was a familiar act of warfare, often
explicable by the simple fact that the horses of an army could not
otherwise be accommodated. The clerical chroniclers mention such
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>things when they can tell a tale of the divine
vengeance. Thus Spelman tells how &ldquo;Richard, Robert, and Anesgot,
sons of William Sorenge, in the time of William Duke of Normandy,
wasting the country about Say, invaded the church of St. Gervase,
lodging their soldiers there, and making it a stable for their horses.
God deferred not the revenge.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2418src" href="#xd21e2418" name="xd21e2418src">10</a> In 1098
&ldquo;the Earl of Shrewsbury made a dog-kennel of the church of St.
Fridank, laying his hounds in it for the night-time; but in the morning
he found them mad.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2423src" href=
"#xd21e2423" name="xd21e2423src">11</a> The putting of cattle in
churches was sometimes a necessity of defensive warfare. In 1358,
according to Jean de Venette, many unfortified villages in France made
citadels of their churches to defend themselves from brigands;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2428src" href="#xd21e2428" name=
"xd21e2428src">12</a> and in such cases the animals would be taken
indoors. Fine churches, on the other hand, were often burned in the
wars of that period.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2435src" href=

likely enough to have stabled their horses in churches. It was probably
of the Turks that Savonarola was thinking, predicting as he so
constantly did their speedy conversion to Christianity.</p>
<p class="par">Lutheranism can have had very little to do with the
matter: the brutality of the German <i lang="de"><span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2449" title="Source: Lanzknechts">Landsknechts</span></i> was
notorious long before Luther was heard of. But there was nothing
specially German <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>in the matter either. The Italian <i lang=
"it">condottieri</i> in general were &ldquo;full of contempt for all
sacred things.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2457src" href=
"#xd21e2457" name="xd21e2457src">15</a> It is instructive to note that
Savonarola predicts nothing of the wholesale violation of nuns and
other women which was to take place at Rome as it had done in a hundred
other sacks of cities: he must have known that these things happened;
but the thing that appealed to his imagination was the theological
pollution resulting from putting horses and pigs in churches. He was
not predicting: he was remembering. Long before his time, besides,
Church Councils had to pass edicts against the use of churches as barns
in time of peace.</p>
<p class="par">It will be remembered that his main items are
slaughters, famines, and pestilences. There was famine and pestilence
in Florence when he was prophesying in 1496; there was more in
1497;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2465src" href="#xd21e2465" name=
"xd21e2465src">16</a> and a terrible pestilence had visited Venice
during the Turkish invasions of 1477 and 1478. The preacher&rsquo;s
description of a plague in a city is an account of what had happened a
dozen times in the history of Florence, before and after <i>the</i>
Plague which figures in the forefront of Boccaccio&rsquo;s <span class=
"sc">Decameron</span>. Preaching from the text of Amos, he arraigns
Italy and Rome as Amos arraigns Israel and Judah; and his menaces are
the menaces of the Hebrew prophet, immeasurable slaughters, famine,
pestilence, and captivity, with the old corollary of regeneration and
restoration, in the case of Italy and the Church as in the case of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=

is at once a Biblical idea and a familiar item from Christian
history.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">the three Western bishops had strictly charged the
crusaders to respect the churches and the persons of the clergy, the
monks, and the nuns. They were talking to the winds. In the frantic
excitement of victory all restraint was flung aside, and the warriors
of the cross abandoned themselves with ferocious greed to their
insatiable and filthy lewdness. With disgusting gestures and in
shameless attire an abandoned woman screamed out a drunken song from
the patriarchal chair in the church of Sancta Sophia.... Wretches blind
with fury drained off draughts of wine from the vessels of the altar;
the table of oblation, famed for its exquisite and costly workmanship,
was shattered; the splendid pulpit with its silver ornaments utterly
defaced. <i>Mules and horses were driven into the churches</i><a class=

they fell they were lashed and goaded till their blood streamed upon
the pavement. While the savages were employed upon these appropriate
tasks, the more devout were busy in ransacking the receptacles of holy
relics and laying up a goodly store of wonder-working bones or teeth to
be carried away to the churches of the great cities on the Rhine, the

<p class="par">Savonarola was simply predicting for Rome, perhaps with
his eye on the Turks, such a fate as befell Constantinople at Christian
hands, regarding both as acts of divine vengeance, and expecting the
capture of Rome to come soon. He pointed to the French
invasion&mdash;he well might&mdash;as showing what was likely to
happen.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2555src" href="#xd21e2555" name=
"xd21e2555src">24</a> The practice of church desecration had never
ceased in Christendom for a single generation. In 1315 Edward Bruce, in
his raid in Ireland, is reported to have burned churches and abbeys
with all the people in them, and to have wrecked and defaced other
churches, with their tombs and monuments. During the centuries between
the battle of Bannockburn and the union of the English and Scottish
crowns, churches, cathedrals, or abbeys were plundered or burned on
both sides in nearly every great border raid. Frenchmen and Burgundians
wrecked each other&rsquo;s churches. In his thirteenth chapter Philip
de Commines tells &ldquo;Of the storming, taking, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>plundering the city of Li&egrave;ge; together
with the ruin and destruction of the very churches.&rdquo; The Duke of
Burgundy set a battalion of his guards to defend them, and killed one
soldier of those who tried to enter; but later the soldiers forced an
entrance, and all were completely plundered. &ldquo;I myself,&rdquo;
says Commines, &ldquo;was in none but the great church, but I was told
so, and saw the marks of it, for which a long time after the Pope
excommunicated all such as had any goods belonging to the churches in
that city unless they restored them; and the duke appointed certain
officers to go up and down his country to see the Pope&rsquo;s sentence
put in execution.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2560src" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">So much for the &ldquo;especially
remarkable&rdquo; fact that churches were desecrated in the sack of
Rome in 1527, and that Savonarola should in 1496 have predicted such
things for his own day. We have seen that his prediction was not a
forecast of the event, that he had no idea of the causation of the
ultimate sack of Rome, that he really prophesied an early event, and
that he was simply announcing speedy divine vengeance after the manner
of the Hebrew and many previous Christian prophets. What ground for
argument, then, does his case furnish for an inference as to the date
of the quasi-prophecy of the fall of Jerusalem in the third Gospel?
Blass, despite his &ldquo;especially remarkable&rdquo; argument, puts
his case pretty low:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Accidentally, you will say, the event [in 1527]
corresponded with the prophecy. But that is not my point, whether it
was accidental, or the prophet had really foreseen the event; for in
the case of the prophecies recorded by Luke you may raise the same
controversy if you like.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2617src" href=
"#xd21e2617" name="xd21e2617src">1</a></p>

<p class="par">What then were the manner and the matter of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=

his prediction upon the non-acceptance by Jerusalem of him and his
mission:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">If thou [Jerusalem] hadst only known in this day
the things which belong unto peace! but now they are hid from thine
eyes. For the days shall come upon thee when thine enemies <i>shall

on every side, and shall dash thee to the ground, and thy children
within thee; and <i>they shall not leave in thee one stone on
another</i> (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

know that her desolation is at hand. Then let them that are in
Jud&aelig;a flee unto the mountains.... For these are days of
vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.... And
they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led captive into
all the nations, and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles,
until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. And there shall be signs
in sun and moon and stars.... And then shall they see the Son of Man
coming in a cloud with power and great glory. But when these things
begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads; because your
redemption draweth nigh (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=

xxi, 20&ndash;28</a>).</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; says Blass, &ldquo;that
either the former or the latter of these foretellings is very distinct,
since there are neither names given nor peculiar circumstances
indicated; only the common order of events is described....&rdquo; That
will certainly not hold in respect of the &ldquo;shall not leave in
thee one stone on another,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;cast up a bank about
thee,&rdquo; which is a distinct specification of the Roman siege
method of 70. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">But let us follow up the implication, which is that a
Jewish vaticinator, mindful of Daniel, might about the year 30 so
predict the events of the year 70, and a world of other events which
never happened, without astonishing us more than does Savonarola.</p>
<p class="par">As we shall see, not only the circumstantial details but
the remainder of the prediction completely exclude the idea of
fortuitous real vaticination, even if it be argued that prophecies of
quite visionary prodigies may conceivably have been made at any date.
As to the prophecy of the fall of the temple, which is common to the
three synoptics, the Professor leaves it &ldquo;out of the present
discussion,&rdquo; seeing that the liberal theologians are willing to
let it stand as a prophecy <i lang="la">ante eventum</i>. Certainly he
may well contemn such a critical method. The prophecy as to the temple,
and that in Matthew (xxiv, 3&ndash;31) and Mark (xiii, 3&ndash;27) as
to the sequence of war, persecution, dissension, false prophets,
evangelization of the whole world, the abomination of desolation in the
holy place, false Christs (twice specified), signs and wonders, and the
final cosmic catastrophe&mdash;all this is certainly on all fours,
critically considered, with the presages in Luke. But how shall
rational criticism be induced to take the whole mass of
quasi-vaticination as the utterance of a wandering thaumaturg of the
year 30? It is idle for Professor Blass to explain to us that when Luke
makes Jesus say &ldquo;Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
Gentiles,&rdquo; with mere reminiscence of the Septuagint Daniel, and
Matthew <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>and Mark make him speak with exact reference to
Sept. Dan. ix, end, they are citing independently from their original.
Their original may just have been the cited passage in Daniel, with no
intervening document. &ldquo;It is self-evident,&rdquo; says the
Professor,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2658src" href="#xd21e2658" name=
"xd21e2658src">2</a> &ldquo;that the real speech of Christ <i>must</i>
have been longer than we read it now in any Gospel.&rdquo; That thesis
cannot be self-evident of which the subject invites and admits a wholly
different explanation; and the &ldquo;must&rdquo; is a sample of the
Professor&rsquo;s critical ethic.</p>
<p class="par">Similarly Dr. Petrie assumes that there were any number
of logia current, all genuine, and that the gospel-makers simply cite
from them wherever they are found appropriate to the circumstances of
the moment. &ldquo;These episodes, thus brought into prominence by the
conditions of the time, were therefore incorporated in the Nucleus, or
in the gospels which grew upon that.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2666src" href="#xd21e2666" name="xd21e2666src">3</a> It now
behoves us to consider that interesting development of traditionalist
theory.</p>
<p class="par">The Nucleus, be it explained, is Dr. Petrie&rsquo;s
substitute for the Primitive Gospel of the school of B. Weiss, and is
constructed by the simple and certainly quite objective process of
selecting &ldquo;everything that is common to all three synoptics in a
parallel text&rdquo;&mdash;that is, occurring in all three in the same
order. This is the &ldquo;structural&rdquo; test, and it yields a
document which does not, like the Weiss selection, end before the Last
Supper, but goes on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108"
name="pb108">108</a>]</span>to the Resurrection. But this Nucleus, be
it noted, was practically complete almost immediately after the
Founder&rsquo;s death. The close &ldquo;suggests a document drawn up
within a few months of the final events.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2673src" href="#xd21e2673" name="xd21e2673src">4</a> How, then,
Dr. Petrie can speak of logia incorporated in the Nucleus in respect of
the conditions of the time, is not very clear. By his account the
prevalent Christian idea about the year 30, <i>during the Ministry</i>,
&ldquo;was the proper understanding of the law, which was not yet
abrogated in any particular.&rdquo; At this stage, accordingly, the
Sermon on the Mount would be the prominent logion. &ldquo;And when we
notice how the fulfilling of the law is the main theme of the nucleus,
and how little [even] of the completed Gospels refer to the Gentile
problems, we must see how devoid of historic sense is the anachronism
of supposing the main body of the Gospels to have originated as late as
the Gentile period&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2681src" href=
"#xd21e2681" name="xd21e2681src">5</a> [<i>i.e.</i> 60&ndash;70!]. But
in 40&ndash;50, with the spread of the Church, as set forth in the
Acts, &ldquo;the Samaritans were welcomed, and Gentile proselytes such
as the centurion Cornelius&rdquo;; whereupon the suitable logia would
be added to the Gospels current. Then in 50&ndash;60, when the Gentiles
began to enter in decisive numbers, there was &ldquo;a special meaning
in the parable of the Prodigal Son, and in the subjection to kings and
rulers&rdquo;; hence further embodiments. Then, after the fall of
Jerusalem in 70, &ldquo;Christianity lost its sense of any tie to
Judaism.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109"
name="pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It will be admitted that this is a stirring change from
the run of New Testament criticism of the past seventy years. That
criticism more or less unconsciously recognized the problem set up by
the entire ignorance of gospel teaching revealed in the Pauline and
other epistles. Dr. Petrie, following Professor Blass in an
unhesitating acceptance of the narrative of the Acts, simply ignores
the Pauline problem altogether. He boldly credits the Church with a
Gospel before Paul&rsquo;s conversion, and, like other traditionalists,
supplies Paul, the gospel-less, with a physician, Luke, who had
collected from the scattered mass of logia more gospel than anybody
else!</p>
<p class="par">Thus has the pendulum swung back to the furthest extreme
from that at which men carried down the Gospel dates to accommodate the
data. As to chronology, Dr. Petrie is practically at the orthodox
standpoint of Professor Salmon.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2695src"
href="#xd21e2695" name="xd21e2695src">6</a> An objective and ostensibly
scientific method, involving no element of personal bias or preference,
is employed to make a selection from the Gospels which shall present as
it were mathematically or statistically the earliest elements in the
synoptics. On that selection, however, there is brought to bear no
further critical principle whatever. It is assumed that it <i>must</i>
all come from the traditional founder, a mass of whose utterances
<i>must</i> have been committed by auditors to writing as they were
delivered (the power to write being held to be common in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>Galilee and Judea in the first century because
it was common in Egypt in the third); and a nucleus collection of these
separate documents <i>must</i> have been made soon after the
crucifixion, and there and then wound up. At any rate, such a
collection is yielded by selecting the groups or blocks of matter which
occur in all three synoptics in the same order; and this <i>must</i>
have been made about the year 30, because it is mainly occupied with
the problems of the law, and very little with &ldquo;the Gentile
problems&rdquo; which so soon began to come to the front. The history
of the Acts is here taken as unassailable ground, like the main Gospel
record.</p>
<p class="par">Two comments here at once suggest themselves. Dr.
Petrie&rsquo;s line of construction might with perfect congruity be
employed to yield evidence that the assumed original <i>Teacher</i> was
mainly concerned with problems of the law; and (2) the inferred
multitude of original floating dicta may with immense gain in
plausibility be transmuted into a series of interpolations made by
different hands long after the supposed Founder&rsquo;s death. For what
critical right has Dr. Petrie to subsume a store of floating Jesuine
dicta which supplied the Church, in its changing circumstances, for
three or four decades, with suitable parables and teachings to meet
every new problem? If you profess to seek a strictly impersonal
principle of selection, why not apply a strictly impersonal principle
of inference from the result?</p>
<p class="par">Obviously the additional logia are far more likely to
have been invented than found. Such a chronic <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>windfall of papyri is a sufficiently fantastic
hypothesis on the face of it, in no way justifiable from the recent
discovery of a few enigmatic scraps that had not been embodied, and
suggest no community of thought with those embodied. But even if we
allow the probable existence of many floating leaves, where is the
likelihood that their sayings all came from the same Teacher? In the
terms of the hypothesis, he occupied himself mainly with the law
(unless the lost logia outbulk the saved), while at the same time he
duly provided for the Samaritans and the Gentiles! His disciples and
apostles, nonetheless, paid no attention to these latter provisions
until they found that such provisions were really necessary to
accommodate the thronging converts! All this is very awkwardly
suggestive of the Moslem saying that the Khalif Omar &ldquo;was many a
time of a certain opinion, and the Koran was revealed
accordingly.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2725src" href=
"#xd21e2725" name="xd21e2725src">7</a> It would indeed have been a
remarkable experience for the evangelist to discover the logion

href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2016:17-19">Mt.
xvi, 17&ndash;19</a>) as to the founding of the Church on the rock of
Peter when a Petrine claim had to be substantiated. To the eye of Dr.
Rendel Harris, an orthodox but a candid scholar, the &ldquo;rock&rdquo;
text suggests an adaptation of a passage in the <span class="sc">Odes
of Solomon</span> in which God&rsquo;s &ldquo;rock&rdquo; is the
foundation not of the Church but of the Kingdom.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2737src" href="#xd21e2737" name="xd21e2737src">8</a> Such
probabilities Dr. Petrie never considers.</p>
<p class="par">Let us see how Dr. Petrie&rsquo;s method explains

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2010:5">Matthew x,
5</a>: &ldquo;Go not into any way of the Gentiles, and enter not into
any city of the Samaritans.&rdquo; It occurs only in Matthew: Luke
gives the parable of the Good Samaritan, with its flings at the lawyer
and at the Jews in general; and in John the Founder makes Samaritan
converts. The anti-Gentile text Dr. Petrie never discusses! Yet his
method does not permit him to exclude it. It belongs to his
&ldquo;sixth class,&rdquo; of &ldquo;sayings and episodes which only
occur in one Gospel. These classes are almost entirely in Matthew and
Luke, and are <i>the accretions which were added after the Gospels had
finally parted company</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2751src"
href="#xd21e2751" name="xd21e2751src">9</a> So that after the Gentile
period had set in, Matthew, the one &ldquo;professional scribe among
the apostles,&rdquo; somehow found a <i>logion Iesou</i> which suited
the need of the Church to exclude Samaritans and Gentiles, while Luke
found another which suited the need to welcome them. And yet, in
respect of its very purport, the anti-Gentile and anti-Samaritan
teaching ought, if genuine, to belong, on Dr. Petrie&rsquo;s general
principle, to the earliest collection of all. Such is the dilemma to
which we are led by the strictly statistical method of selection,
conducted without any higher light. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par first">To the open-minded reader it must be already plain
that, unless we are to be led into mere chaos, there must at once be
added to the statistical test either the proviso that given sayings may
for the purposes of certain sections of the Church have been <i>left
out</i> in certain Gospels, or that for the purposes of certain
sections they may have been invented. And the moment such a concession
is made, the primary assumption of necessary authenticity is destroyed.
If the anti-Samaritan precept is the utterance of the Founder, the
pro-Samaritan parable is not; or else the Founder was literally all
things to all men. If either could be foisted on a gospel, anything
could be; and the futile historical argument to save the prediction of
the fall of Jerusalem&mdash;an argument proceeding, as we have seen, on
a quite uncritical view of one uninvestigated and loosely described
case&mdash;becomes doubly irrelevant. Dr. Petrie&rsquo;s Nucleus of

<p class="par first">The Son of Man shall be <i>betrayed</i> unto the
chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to
death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles <i>to mock, and to
scourge, and to crucify him; and the third day he shall rise
again</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Is <i>that</i> to be salved as historical, on the
pretext <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>that Blass has by the case of Savonarola
&ldquo;exploded the dogma&rdquo; of <i lang="la">omne vaticinium post
eventum</i>, or is to be salved by the plea that Savonarola, like
Lincoln, predicted his own death at the hands of his enemies? And if
prudence perforce abandons that course, why was the vaguer prophecy
about Jerusalem sought to be salved at all? Why was not the miracle
prediction included in the Savonarola argument? Considered as a whole,
the other is not at all a bare prediction of the sacking of a city,
fortuitously fulfilled forty years after utterance: it is a Messianic
judgment, carrying a whole eschatology bound up with it.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2791src" href="#xd21e2791" name="xd21e2791src">1</a>
And the fact that different gospels give it differently is not to be
rationally explained by Professor Blass&rsquo;s device of saying that
Jesus <i>must</i> have said a great deal more still, and that Luke
selected what would appeal to Gentiles, while Matthew and Mark omitted
what would give pain to Jews. This conception of evangelists playing
fast and loose with the known divine oracles to suit men&rsquo;s
susceptibilities ought to be disturbing to any believer&rsquo;s moral
sense; while that of a set of propagandists inventing oracles to suit
their own religious aim puts the Gospel-makers in a line with the whole
succession of Jewish and early Christian framers of supposititious
documents, as men of their age, well-meaning, narrow, deluded, devoted.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">We have come back to the fundamental issue between
authoritarian supernaturalism and free reason. If the prediction of the
betrayal, the trial, the scourging, the mocking, the crucifixion, and
the resurrection is to stand, there need be no more discussion over
miracles or anything else. &ldquo;It is written,&rdquo; and there an
end. Biblical criticism has once more become blasphemy. If reason is to
have any access to the matter, the prediction must fall as a fiction;
and if the &ldquo;exploded&rdquo; argument from Savonarola is to be
revived, it will have to be restricted to the case of the prediction to
which it was so prudentially applied. But if one hopeless prophecy is
to be dropped as <i lang="la">post eventum</i>, it is mere irrelevance
to debate over another which is only in one selected and isolated
aspect less hopeless, while as a whole it is equally so.</p>
<p class="par">Savonarola&rsquo;s prediction of the fall of Rome was
one of many, motived by religion and invited by the absolute fact of
previous invasions, of which the last had occurred only two years
before. The one concrete detail in which it was &ldquo;fulfilled&rdquo;
was simply a specification of a common feature in the warfare of the
age. Another invasion of Italy was believed to be imminent, <i>and
actually took place in the year of the prophecy</i>, without fulfilling
that in any detail. The Gospel prophecy is Messianic, devoid of
political motivation, accompanied by a whole apparatus of Christian
eschatology, and backed by other predictions of pure miracle. The
details of the siege and the sequel are as plainly supplied after the
event as those of the betrayal, the mockery, the scourging,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>the crucifixion, and the resurrection. To hold
by one set of predictions and abandon the other is mere critical
trifling. Even orthodox critics give up the early chapters of Luke as
late accretions. What kind of credit is it that is to be saved by
making him the faithful chronicler of a real prophecy?</p>
<p class="par">The prediction of the fall of the temple, which is in
the Nucleus as being common in matter and order to all three synoptics,
is in no better case. On Dr. Petrie&rsquo;s principle, it is one of the
earliest accepted sayings&mdash;that is, it was embodied when the
Jesuist movement was pre-occupied over the law, and yet it did not
disturb that pre-occupation. On his theory, it should not have appeared
in the Nucleus at all, or in any Gospel until the occasion arose. Thus
incompatible with Dr. Petrie&rsquo;s own theory, it is equally
incompatible with any critical principle. This is a concrete Messianic
prophecy, not to be salved by any juggling with mere historiography. In
the terms of the case, it was made at a time when there was no
politically visible reason for making it,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2825src" href="#xd21e2825" name="xd21e2825src">2</a> and is not
in the least to be explained as were the vaticinations of Savonarola.
On the principles of Professor Blass, it ought to have been far too
&ldquo;painful&rdquo; for preservation by men adhering to the Jewish
law.</p>
<p class="par">It is quite thinkable, of course, that the compilers
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>of the Gospels may have found such
quasi-predictions already committed to writing, and merely embodied
them. But that admission only carries us back to the problem of
authenticity. If any current &ldquo;scrap of paper&rdquo; concerning
&ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; could thus secure
canonicity, what trust is to be put in the canon? It is recorded in the
history of Islam that Abu Daoud, who collected some half-a-million
traditions concerning Mohammed, rejected all but 4,800, which included
&ldquo;the authentic, those which <i>seem</i> to be authentic, and
those which are <i>nearly</i> so.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2847src" href="#xd21e2847" name="xd21e2847src">3</a> This again,
it may be argued, proves that false traditions do not negate the
historicity of the personage they concern. And that is clearly true.
There may conceivably have been a Teacher in whose mouth many invented
sayings were put even in his lifetime. But when we thus come to the
historicity problem, there is simply no such basis in the Gospels as we
have in the life of the confessedly &ldquo;Illiterate Prophet.&rdquo;
The Gospel life begins and ends in miracle, and it yields no
intelligible evangel apart from that ostensibly founded on the
sacrificial death&mdash;the death, that is, of the God.</p>
<p class="par">Apart from the sacramental rite, the whole body of the
Teaching is but a mass of incompatibilities, telling of a dozen
standpoints, legalism and anti-legalism, Judaism and Gentilism,
Davidism and non-Davidism, asceticism and the contrary, a meek Messiah
and one claiming to be greater than Solomon, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>a
Teacher vetoing invective and one freely indulging in it, a popular and
unexplained Gospel for the masses who are declared to be purposely
excluded from comprehension of that very Gospel, whereof the esoteric
explanations yield nothing that could apply to the alleged
propaganda.</p>
<p class="par">Even self-contradictions, it may be argued, do not
negate the authenticity of a teaching. Carlyle and Buskin abound in
them; who escapes them? Many passages in the Koran are contradicted or
abrogated by others, 225 verses being cancelled by later ones.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2859src" href="#xd21e2859" name="xd21e2859src">4</a>
Here indeed there is plain ground for critical doubt; and some of us
must emphatically decline to accept Muir&rsquo;s verdict, endorsing Von
Hammer&rsquo;s, that &ldquo;we may upon the strongest presumption
affirm that every verse in the Koran is the genuine and unaltered
composition of Mohammed himself.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2862src" href="#xd21e2862" name="xd21e2862src">5</a> But even if
we are satisfied that Mohammed in his long life deliberately modified
his doctrine, there is no room for such an explanation in the case of a
teacher who is never once said to avow modification, and whose whole
teaching career ostensibly covers but a year in the synoptic
record.</p>
<p class="par">As the tradition stands, whether read with Unitarian or
with Trinitarian assumptions, it is a mere mosaic of enigma and
contradiction. If the Teacher never called himself the Son of God in a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>miraculous sense, how came the men for whom his
word was law, and who in the terms of the thesis knew his life history
and parentage if any one did, to call him so? In Dr. Petrie&rsquo;s
Nucleus, the triple tradition, the Founder does assure his disciples
that &ldquo;in the regeneration&rdquo; he will sit in the throne of
glory, and they on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes. What room
is there for Gentilism here? And if downright miracle and miraculous
prediction alike be given up as unhistorical, on what grounds can we
give credence to <i>this</i> as a really delivered oracle?</p>
<p class="par">On the other hand, no fundamental difficulty remains
when we recognize that the whole Gospel record is the composite result
of a process of making a life history for a God. The command of the
Messiah to Peter to keep silence as to his Messianic character is quite
intelligible as providing at once the claim by Jesus and an explanation
of the fact that no such Messianic movement was historically recorded.
The blank enigma of the early &ldquo;popular&rdquo; evangel is solved
when we realize that there had been no such evangel; that the cult had
really grown out of the ancient sacramental rite; that the growing
movement had to evolve a quasi-biography when the God of the rite was
to be developed into a Messiah; and that the Judaism of the old
Messianic idea had to be transmuted into universalism when the cult
came to a Gentile growth. All the contradictory texts fall (more or
less clearly) into their orders as survivals of the divergent sects
formed by the changing situation&mdash;or, let us say, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>of
those changing needs of the widening cult which Dr. Petrie so
arbitrarily makes a ground for the mere <i>selection</i> of dicta from
a floating mass of written notes, but which may so much more rationally
be taken as grounds for <i>producing</i> the required oracle.</p>
<p class="par">That there were such scattered and floating oracles,
indeed, we are not critically entitled to deny. The Jud&aelig;o-Greek
world was indeed familiar with oracles of &ldquo;the Lord.&rdquo; The
Gospel Jesus is made to predict that there would come after him many
saying &ldquo;I am Christ&rdquo;; and while the traditionalist must
accept this as true prediction, the historian must pronounce that
various &ldquo;Christs&rdquo; or quasi-Christs did come. We have some
of their names and their brief secular history.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2890src" href="#xd21e2890" name="xd21e2890src">6</a> Each of
these men would be &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; for his followers; and some
of them, surely, propounded some teaching. The Gospel ethic of
reciprocity, we know, was put in a saner form by Hillel; did he get it
from the Jesuists? Christian scholars do not claim as much.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2899src" href="#xd21e2899" name="xd21e2899src">7</a>
There is no Messianic item in the Gospels, apart from the lore of the
sacrament, which may not have been in the legend of any
&ldquo;Christ.&rdquo; As it happens, the best authenticated saying of
&ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; is one which no Christian now accepts&mdash;the
fantastic millenarian prediction given by Papias, who had it from
&ldquo;the elders who saw John, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>disciple of the
Lord,&rdquo; and textually quoted by Iren&aelig;us, who is practically
corroborated by Eusebius. The latter, it is true, pronounces Papias
very limited in his comprehension;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2914src"
href="#xd21e2914" name="xd21e2914src">8</a> but has not the same thing
been said many times of the disciples by believers in the gospel
Jesus?</p>
<p class="par">The logion preserved from Papias, we know, is in the
<span class="sc">Apocalypse of Baruch</span>, which imitated the
<span class="sc">Book of Enoch</span>, both of which are full of
oracles of &ldquo;the Lord.&rdquo; But this only proves that oracles
passing current in other quarters and of another source could pass
current with devout Jesuists as oracles of Jesus. The <span class=
"sc">Apocalypse of Baruch</span> is pronounced by Canon Charles, who
has so ably edited that and other remains of Jewish literature of the
same age, a &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; book, &ldquo;almost the last noble
utterance of Judaism before it plunged in the dark and oppressive years
that followed the destruction of Jerusalem&rdquo;; a book written when
&ldquo;breathing thought and burning word had still their home in
Palestine, and the hand of the Jewish artist was still master of its
ancient cunning.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2931src" href=
"#xd21e2931" name="xd21e2931src">9</a> It was admittedly long more
widely current in Christian than in Jewish circles, and fell into
discredit only when it was felt to contain &ldquo;an implicit polemic
against Christianity.&rdquo; It is to its early Christian vogue that we
owe its preservation in a Syriac translation made from the Greek:
&ldquo;of the Hebrew <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122"
name="pb122">122</a>]</span>original every line has perished, save a
few still surviving in rabbinic writings.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Who can say how many other such Jewish books may not
have furnished items for the compilers of the Gospels? The Sermon on
the Mount we know is a Judaic compilation; and the &ldquo;Slavonic
<span class="sc">Enoch</span>&rdquo; contains sets of beatitudes
closely analogous to those of the Sermon. To the traditionalist these
things are matters of profound perplexity; for the rational critic they
are evidences for the naturalist conception of the rise of
Christianity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=

<p class="par first">When the &ldquo;selection&rdquo; theory is applied
to the <i>logia</i> actually recovered at Oxyrhynchus it conspicuously
fails to square these with the traditionalist assumption. On Dr.
Petrie&rsquo;s principle they were left out of the Nucleus and Gospels
alike because they met <i>no</i> need of the Christian organization.
That is to say, oracles of the Son of God were simply ignored by the
apostles and the organizers because they did not serve any useful
purpose. Independent criticism finds in them plain marks of Judaism, of
Gnosticism, of Christian heresy, and of a Christism irreconcilable with
the Gospel record.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2957src" href=
"#xd21e2957" name="xd21e2957src">1</a> Logion iv, iii, <i>a</i>, runs:
&ldquo;I stood in the midst of the world, and in flesh I was seen of
them; and I found all drunken, and none found I athirst among
them&rdquo; [<i>sc.</i> for the word]&mdash;the saying of a
retrospective Christ, no longer in the flesh, such as we find in the
Gnostic <span class="sc">Pistis Sophia</span> and the <span class=
"sc">Odes Of Solomon</span>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2976src" href=
"#xd21e2976" name="xd21e2976src">2</a> On the traditionalist view this
at least <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>must be tolerably late; what then does the
&ldquo;selection&rdquo; argument gain from the recovered papyri?</p>
<p class="par">But it fares no better when confronted with the opening
chapters of Luke. For the Blass school these are to be dated
50&ndash;60. Already Luke&rsquo;s &ldquo;many&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2986src" href="#xd21e2986" name="xd21e2986src">3</a> had drawn
up their narratives; and these, we are to suppose, included the miracle
story of the birth of John, the Annunciation, the kinship and
intercourse of Elizabeth and Mary, the preparation of John &ldquo;in
the desert,&rdquo; a different account of the birth at Bethlehem, the
appearance of the Divine Child in the Temple, and all the rest of it;
but no mention of the flight into Egypt. We are asked to believe that
all these added narratives were current among the faithful &ldquo;from
the first,&rdquo; but that Mark and Matthew did not see fit to include
them in their Gospels, though Matthew saw reason to tell of the flight
into Egypt, and Luke to suppress it. Whatever may be the outcome of the
&ldquo;liberal&rdquo; method of handling the Gospels, it is safe to say
that this will never appease the critical spirit. The &ldquo;gospel of
the Infancy&rdquo; thus embodied in Luke is visibly cognate with the
&ldquo;apocryphal&rdquo; gospels which were never allowed into the
canon, but were more or less popular in the Church. A compromise
between traditionalism and the statistical method may set up the
position that the stories were current from the first, although all
fictitious; but this involves the awkward consequence that the whole
atmosphere &ldquo;from the first&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>is one of
unrestrained invention. Would the inventors of all these myths have any
scruple about putting in the mouth of &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; any medley
of teachings collected from the present and the past?</p>
<p class="par">Luke inserts the episode of the mission of the seventy,
with the usual lack of time measurement, between the mission of the
twelve and the decisive visit to Jerusalem. In this narrative, the
twelve bring back no message, merely reporting &ldquo;what things they
had done.&rdquo; Their mission is in effect made of no account: we read
of more miracles, predictions of the approaching tragedy, the
Transfiguration, and a series of episodes disparaging the disciples;
and then we come upon the mission of the seventy, who are &ldquo;sent
two and two before his face into every city and place whither he
himself was about to come.&rdquo; To the seventy is now ascribed the
joyful report which the Weiss school calmly assign to the Primitive
Gospel, and ascribe to the returning twelve, though Matthew and Mark
have no mention of it. Thus Luke is in effect represented as connecting
with a new mission story a result which he found connected in the
primitive story with the mission of the twelve, while Matthew and Mark
had seen fit to suppress the result altogether.</p>
<p class="par">What gain in credibility, then, is effected by
substituting the &ldquo;selection&rdquo; theory for one in which the
third evangelist is implicitly represented as a framer of fiction? For
Dr. Petrie, the story of the seventy is a logion ignored by the first
two Gospel-makers, presumably as serving no purpose, albeit
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>one of the most important items in the history.
What kind of narrators, then, were the men who passed it over? The
alternatives are equally destructive to credence: on either view we are
dealing with men who would invent anything or suppress anything. And
yet the subject of the missions lies at the core of the historical
problem. To the eye of rational criticism it is an evolving legend. If
we take Mark as the first selector or collector, we have the twelve
sent forth &ldquo;by two and two&rdquo; without money or supplies; with
authority over unclean spirits; and with no specified message whatever,
though the twelve are to make a solemn and minatory testimony against
those who refuse to hear them. &ldquo;And they went out, and preached
that men should repent. And they cast out many devils, and anointed
with oil many that were sick, and healed them.&rdquo; They make no
report.</p>
<p class="par">In Matthew, similarly, the twelve are empowered to cast
out spirits and heal diseases, and are &ldquo;sent forth&rdquo; with a
peremptory veto on any visit to Samaritans or Gentiles, to
&ldquo;preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick,
raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out devils: <i>freely ye
received, freely give</i>.&rdquo; As in Mark, they are to go
unfurnished; and are to withhold their peace from the unworthy,
testifying as aforesaid. Then ensues a long discourse, with no
explanation of the kingdom of heaven, though the missioners are to
&ldquo;proclaim upon the housetops&rdquo; what they &ldquo;hear in the
ear.&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;when Jesus had made an end of commanding his
twelve disciples, <i>he</i> departed thence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>to
teach and preach in their cities.&rdquo; Of the mission there is not
another word: the disciples are not even mentioned as returning.</p>
<p class="par">Upon this kind of basis Luke erects a new structure. The
twelve are sent forth to exorcise, heal, and preach, unfurnished; and
as before they are to give testimony against those who will not receive
them. &ldquo;And they departed, and went throughout the villages,
preaching <i>the Gospel</i>, and healing everywhere.&rdquo; &ldquo;And
the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things
they had done.&rdquo; The story is not suppressed, and it is supplied
with a conclusion; but it is on the mission of the seventy that stress
is visibly laid: they &ldquo;return with joy,&rdquo; and are told to
rejoice that their names are written in heaven. &ldquo;In that same
hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;; and after the discourse on
the Father and the Son<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3018src" href=
"#xd21e3018" name="xd21e3018src">4</a> the disciples are
&ldquo;privately&rdquo; told that many prophets and kings had desired
in vain to see and hear what they had seen and heard.</p>
<p class="par">In face of all this the methods of the Bernhard Weiss
school and the selection theory are alike invalid. They furnish no
explanation. The third Gospel is simply substituting a mission to the
Gentiles for a mission to the Jews, under cover of a story of a
preparatory mission to all the places that were to be visited by the
Teacher on his way to his death at Jerusalem. The seventy&mdash;in some
MSS. seventy-two&mdash;stand for the seventy or seventy-two
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>peoples into whom, by Jewish tradition, mankind
was divided. The notion that a genuine logion of this kind was all
along lying ready to be used is surely fantastic. It is a planned myth,
eking out the main myth. It yields only the same Gospel of one phrase,
not meant to be understood by the hearers. But it carries in symbol a
provision for the Gentiles; and immediately upon it there follows the
story of the Good Samaritan, demonstrating that the real tie among men
is not nationality but humanity, and impeaching the fanaticism and
hypocrisy of the Jewish leaders.</p>
<p class="par">Facing once more the sharp antithesis between this and
the strictly Judaic command in Matthew, we dismiss as a futility the
notion that the same teacher delivered both about the same time, and
that the pro-Gentile compiler merely &ldquo;selected&rdquo; one and
dropped the other. The two sayings are framed for two schools or two
sects; and it is idle to see history in either. <i>If</i> the deified
Teacher had delivered the first, the second would have been a daring
blasphemy. They are alike but men&rsquo;s counsels ascribed to
&ldquo;the Lord.&rdquo; To this conclusion we are always driven. The
starting-point of the diverging sects must be looked for in something
else than a body of oracular teaching of any kind. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The diverging schools of documentary
&ldquo;construction&rdquo; being thus alike unable to yield a coherent
notion either of the process of Gospel-making or of the beginnings of
the cultus, it is not surprising to find yet a third school of
scholarly interpretation undertaking to do better, and to build on an
&ldquo;oral&rdquo; basis where others have vainly built on documents.
This theory, long ago predominant in Germany,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3043src" href="#xd21e3043" name="xd21e3043src">1</a> is latterly
represented in England by the Rev. Arthur Wright, author of
<span class="sc">The Composition of the Gospels</span>, a <span class=
"sc">Synopsis of the Gospels</span>, and <span class="sc">Some New
Testament Problems</span>.</p>
<p class="par">Writing before the appearance of Dr. Petrie&rsquo;s
treatise, Mr. Wright did not contemplate that development of the later
school which gives the earliest possible dates for the Gospels; but we
may feel sure that he would give it small quarter. Himself essentially
orthodox, and making without question all the primary assumptions of
historicity, he dates the Epistle of James before the year 50,
Paul&rsquo;s Epistles to the Thessalonians in the year 52; Mark
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>about 70; Matthew &ldquo;not much&rdquo; later;
Luke in 80; and John later still.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3064src"
href="#xd21e3064" name="xd21e3064src">2</a> He is not tied to the
synoptics: when they become unmanageable he vigorously rectifies them
by the aid of the Fourth Gospel. But on his own lines he is so candid
that he can always be read with pleasure; and his arguments are well
worth consideration.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Wright&rsquo;s theory, in brief, is that the
Gospels, one and all, represent the late consignment to paper of matter
preserved from the first in the Christian catechetical schools, given
by the apostles and preserved by their pupils in the Rabbinical
fashion. As Matthew divides plausibly into fifty-one lessons, and Mark
in the Westcott and Hort text into forty-eight paragraphs, it is
suggested that the plan in both cases had been to attain to a set of
fifty-one or fifty-two; and</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">If there really was an attempt to provide every
Sunday with a Gospel of its own, we shall understand why the formation
of Gospel sections proceeded rapidly at first and then ceased; we shall
understand why all our Gospels are so short and contain so little which
is not essential; we shall understand how S. Mark&rsquo;s order became
fixed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3074src" href="#xd21e3074" name=
"xd21e3074src">3</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">This plausible but dangerous detail, however, is not
insisted on; what is essential is the datum of long oral tradition.
Orthodox as he is, too, Mr. Wright holds that <a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%201">Luke i</a>;
<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"

href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%203:23-38">iii,
23&ndash;38</a>, &ldquo;are comparatively late additions, which never
formed part of the primitive oral teaching.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3090src" href="#xd21e3090" name="xd21e3090src">4</a> Thus he
can summarily get rid of a number of incredibilities which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>the
other schools more prudently leave to be excised by the reader as he
sees fit. But we shall find him making a stout fight for many
others.</p>
<p class="par">On the &ldquo;oral&rdquo; theory every Church had its
own tradition,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3099src" href="#xd21e3099"
name="xd21e3099src">5</a> &ldquo;differing both in contents and wording
from that of other Churches, and in particular exhibiting much mixture
and <i>many sayings of Christ which are not in our Gospels at
all</i>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3108src" href="#xd21e3108"
name="xd21e3108src">6</a>&mdash;an interesting approximation, in
effect, to the theory of scattered leaflets. Thus is to be accounted
for the endless variety in Gospel phrasing and detail. For Mr. Wright,
further, it is inconceivable that any evangelist left out anything he
knew of. &ldquo;The common idea&rdquo; (before Dr. Petrie) &ldquo;that
they picked and selected what was specially adapted to their readers, I
most confidently reject.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3113src"
href="#xd21e3113" name="xd21e3113src">7</a> Matthew would gladly have
given the parable of the Prodigal Son, and Luke the story of the
Syroph&oelig;nician woman, which would so well have suited his
purpose.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3118src" href="#xd21e3118" name=
"xd21e3118src">8</a> &ldquo;He did not give it because he had never
heard of it.&rdquo; Thus, in brief, Mr. Wright posits much teaching
lost even from the oral tradition, as Dr. Petrie posits many lost
leaflets.</p>
<p class="par">But Mr. Wright&rsquo;s conception of the oral tradition,
upon scrutiny, becomes disquieting to the critical sense. In one place,
discussing Luther&rsquo;s estimate of the Epistle of James as an
epistle of straw, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132"
name="pb132">132</a>]</span>remarks&mdash;with a great deal more truth,
I fancy, than he dreams of&mdash;that James&rsquo;s Epistle &ldquo;is
Christianity in swaddling-clothes.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3125src" href="#xd21e3125" name="xd21e3125src">9</a> Again, the
opening verses of John&rsquo;s Gospel &ldquo;reveal a depth of
knowledge to which S. James never attained. Not that S. James would
have contradicted them or doubted their truth. But it is one thing to
see truth when it is set before you; it is another to set it forth
yourself. There is such a thing as latent knowledge.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3130src" href="#xd21e3130" name=
"xd21e3130src">10</a> Yet on the same page with the swaddling-clothes
passage Mr. Wright has said, with regard to Mark&rsquo;s omission of
the words, &ldquo;Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Was it humility that made him deliberately omit
them as too good for so insignificant a creature as himself to record?
Or was it a conscious or unconscious feeling that they were unsuited to
his readers? A man with such preposterous humility was ill-equipped for
the work of an evangelist. Readers so unchristian would not value a
Gospel.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">What now becomes of the two presentments of James and
John? Both must presumably have known most that was to be known,
<i lang="la">ex hypothesi</i>. Yet James has not a word of specifically
Christian doctrine, and, save in two sentences, one of which has every
appearance of interpolation, while the other is only less suspicious,
no mention of Jesus. John, on the other hand, as an apostle (whether or
not the beloved one), must on the theory have heard many of the sayings
given in the synoptics, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133"
href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>he does not report. Why does
he not? Had <i>he</i> never heard of the &ldquo;Come unto me&rdquo;
allocution? Could <i>he</i> conceivably have put it aside from a
preposterous humility? If he had not heard that, had he not heard the
Sermon on the Mount, or any of the parable-solutions given in the
synoptics as specially addressed to the twelve disciples? Can Mr.
Wright, holding by the central tradition of Jesus and the twelve,
believe that John had heard none of the teachings which he does not
repeat? If, on the other hand, he admits wholesale suppression in
John&rsquo;s case, what becomes of the argument above cited?</p>
<p class="par">It matters little that Mr. Wright credits John with
evolving the <i>Logos</i> doctrine out of his own profound meditation,
and with having &ldquo;remoulded&rdquo; the sayings of Jesus which he
does give. That is a standing device of exegesis, Unitarian and
Trinitarian alike; and by his account the general oral tradition did
the same thing indefinitely. But all the while Mr. Wright is going a
great deal further. He alternately insists that every evangelist told
all he knew, and assumes that the two evangelists who are alleged to
have been apostles did not. If, he writes&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">If, as becomes increasingly probable, a Johannine
course of teaching was extant in comparatively early times, it is not
strange that, as S. John dealt chiefly with the Jud&aelig;an ministry,
S. Peter should have refused to intrude into his brother
Apostle&rsquo;s domain. <i>They may have agreed at the outset to divide
the work thus between them.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">It is impossible to reconcile this with Mr.
Wright&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>theory of the inclusiveness of the evangelists.
Why should not Mark do what Matthew and John did in the terms of the
case?</p>
<p class="par">Of course this is not the true critical solution; the
immediate question is the consistency of Mr. Wright&rsquo;s critical
principles. To the eye of unbiassed criticism the &ldquo;Come unto
me&rdquo; logion is not a possible oracle at all; it is an
unintelligently inserted liturgical formula from the mysteries,
misplaced and meaningless as a public teaching.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3170src" href="#xd21e3170" name="xd21e3170src">11</a> As regards
the fair historical inference from the wide difference between the
synoptic Gospels and the fourth, it is not possible to accept any of
Mr. Wright&rsquo;s solutions, tried by his own tests. To suggest that
John had not &ldquo;heard&rdquo; of the Virgin Birth story is for him
impossible, unless he post-dates that as he does the birth-stories in
Luke. If he follows that course, what can he make of the 13th chapter
of John, a palpable interpolation or substitution between the 12th and
the 14th, which form a sequence that the 13th absolutely
breaks?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3176src" href="#xd21e3176" name=
"xd21e3176src">12</a> If that interpolation be admitted, what exactly
is left to fight for?</p>
<p class="par">In any case, the implication that Matthew, the apostle,
&ldquo;had not heard of&rdquo; what John declares to be the first
miracle, or of the raising of Lazarus, is as destructive of every
traditionalist assumption as is the implication that John the Apostle
had not heard of the Sermon on the Mount, or of the parables of the
mystery of the kingdom. Mark <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href=
"#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>and Luke expressly declare that
John was present at the raising of Jairus&rsquo; daughter; and the
fourth Gospel makes no mention of it. It was perhaps to meet cruces of
this kind that Mr. Wright makes John and Peter &ldquo;divide between
them&rdquo; the portions of the ministry; but such a device simply
destroys, as we have seen, another main part of his case. Mr. Wright
may well reject the thesis of Mr. Halcombe, who, severely condemning
&ldquo;modern criticism,&rdquo; produces a modern criticism of his own,
which makes John&rsquo;s Gospel the <i>first</i>&mdash;another of the
hopeless devices of traditionalist critics to escape from the imbroglio
of the tradition. Mr. Halcombe gravely reasons that the best Gospel
came first; and Mr. Wright pronounces that &ldquo;such a plan of
composition seems unworthy of God and incredible in
man.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3186src" href="#xd21e3186" name=
"xd21e3186src">13</a> But his own theory presents only a different set
of incredibilities. He accepts without a misgiving the most staggering
anomalies. &ldquo;If it were not for a single incidental statement in
S. John&rdquo; (iv, 1, 2), he writes, &ldquo;we should have concluded
confidently that the sacrament of holy baptism was first instituted
after the Resurrection.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s statement is in fact the
sole intimation that Jesus or the disciples ever baptized at all; and
it is either a designed or redacted equivoque or a flat contradiction
in terms:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">When therefore <i>the Lord knew that the Pharisees
had heard</i> that Jesus was making <i>and baptizing more disciples
than John (although Jesus himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136"
href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>baptized not, but his
disciples</i>), he left Jud&aelig;a, and departed again into
Galilee.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The exegesis which can take this for a historical datum,
and compose it with the theory of an oral tradition in which baptism
either by Jesus or by his disciples never appears, is really outside
serious discussion. The proposition that, given the main tradition,
either Jesus or the disciples baptized freely, and that yet neither
Matthew, Mark, nor Luke ever heard of it, is a mere flouting of the
critical reason to which it professes to appeal. And there is no
alternative save an honest confession that the record is incredible.
The whole Christian tradition of baptism breaks down on examination, as
does the record of the acceptance of the higher mission of Jesus by
John, followed by statements affirming the continuance of John&rsquo;s
movement and teaching alongside of the Jesuine. Mr. Wright is severe on
the orthodox harmonists in general. &ldquo;If I am right,&rdquo; he
remarks, &ldquo;the exhausting labours and tortuous explanations of the
harmonists, in their endeavour to reconcile what cannot be reconciled,
have been wasted.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3203src" href=
"#xd21e3203" name="xd21e3203src">14</a> That is exactly what the
attentive reader must regretfully say of Mr. Wright&rsquo;s own
reconstructions.</p>
<p class="par">His handling of the problems of the date of the
crucifixion and the duration of the Ministry is a warning to every
student who desires to be loyal to critical principle. By his final
admission, no one can tell whether the Ministry lasted one, two, three,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>four, ten, or twenty years. He frankly rejects
Sir William Ramsay&rsquo;s attempt to salve as history Luke&rsquo;s
story of the census. The alleged procedure, he sees, is simply
impossible&mdash;&ldquo;S. Luke evidently has somewhat misunderstood
the situation&rdquo;&mdash;and he solves the problem by throwing over
Luke&rsquo;s opening chapters as late accretions. But the question of
the duration of the Ministry, which is bound up with that of the date
of the crucifixion, and thus lies at the very centre of the whole
historic problem, he is content to leave as insoluble, yet without a
misgiving as to the historicity of the record.</p>
<p class="par">John makes Jesus go four times to Jerusalem; while in
the synoptics we note &ldquo;the extraordinary fact that they do not
bring Christ to Jerusalem until He entered it to be
crucified.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3214src" href="#xd21e3214"
name="xd21e3214src">15</a> John puts the cleansing of the temple at the
beginning of the Ministry, and the synoptics place it at the close.
Orthodox exegesis then assumes two cleansings, but &ldquo;such a
repetition is, to say the least, highly improbable,&rdquo; for Mr.
Wright. &ldquo;What end would such a repetition serve? And if repeated,
why should not S. Mark or S. John have told us so?&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3219src" href="#xd21e3219" name=
"xd21e3219src">16</a> Why, indeed! So Mr. Wright suggests that the
synoptics may have telescoped several years into one. &ldquo;Events in
real life move much more slowly.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3224src" href="#xd21e3224" name="xd21e3224src">17</a> They
certainly do!</p>
<p class="par">Yet, on the other hand, &ldquo;the one-year ministry
would solve many difficulties. It is the only scheme which reconciles
S. Luke, S. Matthew, and S. John. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138"
href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>Not improbably it is true:
the more I consider it, the more attractive it appears.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3233src" href="#xd21e3233" name=
"xd21e3233src">18</a> Such, evidently, was the view of the Christian
and other Gnostics. But Iren&aelig;us, the first Father to handle the
problem, declared for a ministry of about twenty years, founding not
only on the quotation in John, &ldquo;Thou art not yet fifty years
old,&rdquo; but on the fact that &ldquo;all the elders who had known
John the disciple of the Lord in Asia witness that he gave them this
tradition.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3238src" href="#xd21e3238"
name="xd21e3238src">19</a> On the other hand, in Mr. Wright&rsquo;s
opinion, &ldquo;ten years is the utmost length to which we can stretch
the ministry without throwing overboard S. Luke&rsquo;s chronology
altogether.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3246src" href=
"#xd21e3246" name="xd21e3246src">20</a> Yet Bishop Westcott declared
concerning the record of Iren&aelig;us that, &ldquo;however strange it
may appear, some such view is not inconsistent with the only fixed
historical dates which we have with regard to the Lord&rsquo;s life,
the date of His birth, His baptism, and the banishment of
Pilate.&rdquo; Thus turns the kaleidoscope of the tradition of which
Harnack has latterly affirmed the &ldquo;essential rightness, with a
few important exceptions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It is hardly necessary to point out that the
&ldquo;oral&rdquo; hypothesis, like the &ldquo;documentary&rdquo; and
that of scattered logia, is more compatible with the negative than with
the affirmative answer on the question of historicity. Contradictions
and anomalies irreconcilable with the assumption of a real historical
process present not difficulty but confirmation to the theory of a
fictitious production, whether documentary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>or
oral, to establish a transforming cult, supplying a quasi-historical
basis where none such existed. Contradictory episodes and dicta stand
for diverging sects and movements. Save for incidental concessions, all
the traditionist schools alike ignore the grounds for inferring a
long-continued modification of the Gospels at many hands; though, when
Celsus late in the second century alleged the common practice of
interpolation, Origen could only explain that it was the work of
heretics. Such a procedure is for the rational critic only the natural
continuance of the method of formation.</p>
<p class="par">Over the point upon which Mr. Wright most completely
diverges from the various Unitarian schools&mdash;his acceptance of the
Fourth Gospel as essentially historical&mdash;we need not here concern
ourselves. Those who can accept the Fourth <i>and</i> the Synoptics
cannot be supposed to admit the application of criticism to
fundamentals at all, however critically they may handle secondary
issues. And they have their defence. The liberalizers who see that the
Fourth as a whole is a work of invention, making free play with
previous material, and yet cannot conceive that the synoptics had
beforehand followed a similar method, can make no claim to critical
consistency. They merely realize that the Fourth and the Synoptics
cannot <i>all</i> be records of a real Life and Teaching, and they
decide to reject the last rather than the prior documents. The argument
from &ldquo;vividness&rdquo; and lifelike detail simply goes by the
board. In the fourth Gospel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href=
"#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>there are many more lifelike
details than in the second; but that is not allowed to count.</p>
<p class="par">For the rational inquirer, however, the fact remains
that the dismissal of the fourth Gospel is a beginning of historical as
distinct from documentary discrimination; and it is to those who have
made such a beginning that a further critical argument falls to be
addressed. Mr. Wright, facing a chaos of doctrinal contradictions and
chronological divergences, falls back trustingly on the reflection that
&ldquo;after all we are not saved by the Gospels, but by Christ.&rdquo;
He has no misgiving as to the evangelists being inspired.
&ldquo;Inspiration quickens their spiritual perception, but does not
<i>altogether</i> preserve them from errors of fact&rdquo;: <i>e.g.</i>

<h2 class="main">THE METHOD OF M. LOISY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Turning away, so to speak, to the Gentiles, we
concentrate our case in countering that of the
&ldquo;emancipated&rdquo; defenders of the historicity of the Founder,
as put by M. Loisy, the equal of any of the German or English
professionals in scholarly competence, and the superior of some of them
in candour. Precisely because Catholicism yields least preparation for
the work of critical science, one who slowly makes his way out of it
into the &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; position is reasonably to be credited
with a special capacity for the task. And he is on the whole the most
useful theorist for the purposes of the &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; school,
inasmuch as he is prepared to give up many documentary items to which
others needlessly cling. Nonetheless, M. Loisy is a confident champion
of the historicity of the gospel Jesus. He does not indeed combine his
summary presentment of his case with a discussion of the myth
theory&mdash;that he is content to put aside in mass with the epithet
&ldquo;superficial&rdquo;; but he puts his own construction all the
more unreservedly.</p>
<p class="par">It is interesting to note his certitudes. No one of his
school, perhaps, has more frequently claimed indubitability on points
of inference. For instance:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142"
href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The advent of Jesus in the time of the procurator
Pontius Pilate is a fact as certain as a thousand other facts on the
subject of which no one dreams of raising the slightest suspicion; it
is <i>not doubtful</i> that he announced the speedy coming of the
kingdom of God ... <i>since</i> that idea ... which is the fundamental
idea of the preaching of Christ in the synoptics, was
<i>incontestably</i> that of his first disciples and Paul....</p>
<p class="par">Great as are the real obscurities of the evangelical
history, they are less numerous than they seem, and <i>without
doubt</i> also less considerable on the important points.</p>
<p class="par">Paul ... does not say that Jesus predicted his death and
resurrection. He does not even say what was the ground for his
execution; but it <i>does not seem doubtful</i> that this ground was
<i>precisely</i> the announcement of that kingdom of God which the
apostles and Paul himself preached.</p>
<p class="par">Paul and the other apostles practised exorcisms in the
name of Jesus on certain patients. It is told that Jesus had done the
same, and <i>without doubt</i> he had really done it, with still more
assurance and more success than his disciples.</p>
<p class="par">He [Jesus] <i>without doubt</i> never frequented the
schools of the rabbins.</p>
<p class="par">His family was <i>certainly</i> pious.</p>
<p class="par">One fact is <i>certain</i>, that a seizure was concerted
of which he [Judas] was the principal agent.</p>
<p class="par">It was <i>without doubt</i> arranged [at the house of
the high priest at earliest daylight] that they should content
themselves with denouncing the Galilean prophet to the Roman
authority.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Without doubt</i> he [Jesus] expected to his last
moment the succour which only death could bring him.</p>
<p class="par">It was Peter, <i>it would seem</i>, who first obtained
the proof and the definitive certainty [of the resurrection] that faith
called for. One day, at dawn, fishing on the lake of Tiberias, he saw
Jesus. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>Already, <i>without doubt</i>, he had assembled
around him the other disciples.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3379src"
href="#xd21e3379" name="xd21e3379src">1</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">It is enviable to be so <i lang="fr">sans doute</i> on
so many points in a narrative of which so much has had to be abandoned
as myth. The odd thing is that with all these certitudes M. Loisy
introduces his book with the declaration, &ldquo;We must [<i lang=
"fr">il faut</i>] now renounce writing the life of Jesus. All the
critics agree in recognizing that the materials are insufficient for
such an enterprise.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3392src" href=
"#xd21e3392" name="xd21e3392src">2</a> And then, after an introduction
in which he contests the view that nothing can be written with
certainty, he gives us a Life of Jesus which is simply Renan
revised!</p>
<p class="par">It is certainly brief; but that is because he is content
to say only what he thinks there is to say, whereas his predecessors
were at more or less pains to embed the thin thread of biography in a
large mat of non-biographical material. M. Loisy seems to have become a
little confused in the process of prefixing a critical introduction to
three chapters of the former introduction to his commentary on the
synoptics. &ldquo;The present little book,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;does not pretend to be that history which it is impossible to
recover.&rdquo; Naturally not. But it proffers a Life of Jesus all the
same.</p>
<p class="par">M. Loisy is quite satisfied that there was a Jesus of
Nazareth, son of Joseph, a &ldquo;worker in wood, carpenter, furniture
maker, wheelwright.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3402src" href=
"#xd21e3402" name="xd21e3402src">3</a> &ldquo;And <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>Jesus followed originally the same
profession.&rdquo; When he began his preaching of the speedy coming of
the heavenly kingdom, &ldquo;his mother Mary was a widow, with numerous
children. It is not certain that Jesus was the eldest....&rdquo;
&ldquo;It was probably John the Baptist who, unknowingly, awoke the
vocation of the young carpenter of Nazareth. The crisis which traversed
Jud&aelig;a had evoked a prophet.... This preaching of terror made a
great impression.... John was usually on the Jordan, baptizing in the
river those touched by his burning words. Jesus was drawn like many
others.... He was baptized, <i>and remained some time in the
desert</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">And so it goes on. &ldquo;What appears most
probable&rdquo; is that Jesus had already &ldquo;passed some time in
solitude. A time of reflection and of preparation was indispensable
between the life of the carpenter and the manifestation of the preacher
of the evangel. Pushed to the desert by the sentiment of his vocation,
Jesus was bound (<i lang="fr">devait</i>) to be pursued by a more and
more clear consciousness of that vocation.&rdquo; Thus M. Loisy can
after all expand his sources. It was after the imprisonment of the
Baptist that Jesus felt he &ldquo;was to replace him, and by the better
title because he felt himself predestined to become the human chief of
the Kingdom, there to fill the function of Messiah.&rdquo; But
&ldquo;almost in spite of himself&rdquo; he worked miracles. From his
first stay at Capernaum the sick were brought to him to heal; and,
fearing that the thaumaturg might hurt the preacher of the Kingdom, he
left the place, only to be followed up and forced to make <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>cures. &ldquo;He operated with a peculiar
efficacy on the category of patients supposed to be specially possessed
by the demon.... He spoke to them with authority, and calm returned, at
least for a time, to those troubled and unquiet souls.&rdquo; As to the
greater cures, M. Loisy observes that &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; there was
ascribed to the healer the revivification of a dead maiden. On the
instantaneous cures of lepers and the blind he naturally says nothing
whatever.</p>
<p class="par">The dilemma of M. Loisy here recalls that of Professor
Schmiedel over the same problem. The latter, claiming that it would be
&ldquo;difficult to deny&rdquo; healing powers to Jesus, in view of the
testimonies, is fain to argue that the Healer&rsquo;s personal claim
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2011:5">Mt. xi,
5</a>; <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%207:22">Lk. vii,
22</a>; not in Mk.) to have healed the sick, the blind, the deaf, the
lepers, and raised the dead, meant only a spiritual ministration,
inasmuch as the claim concludes: &ldquo;the poor also have the Gospel
preached to them.&rdquo; On this view the assumed healing power really
counts for nothing; and the last clause, which Schmiedel contends would
be an anti-climax if the healings were real, becomes absolutely an
anti-climax of the most hopeless kind. One day men will dismiss such
confusions by noting that the theory of spiritual healing, an attempt
to evade the mass of miracle, is only miracle-mongering of another
kind. Are we to take it that regeneration of the morally dead, deaf,
blind, and leprous is to be effected wholesale by a little preaching?
Did the Christian community then consist wholly or mainly of these?</p>
<p class="par">M. Loisy in turn blenches at a claim in which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>&ldquo;raising the dead&rdquo; figures as a
customary thing, with cures of leprosy and blindness; and he too falls
back on the &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; interpretation,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3431src" href="#xd21e3431" name="xd21e3431src">4</a> failing
to note the flat fallacy of making the preaching to the poor at once a
contrast and a climax to the spiritual healings, which also, on the
hypothesis, are precisely matters of preaching. The Teacher is made to
say: &ldquo;I raise the spiritually dead, and cure the spiritually
leprous, deaf, and blind, by preaching to them: to the poor I just
preach.&rdquo; Schmiedel does not see that the preaching of the Gospel
to the poor is added as the one thing that could be said to be done for
them, who would otherwise have had no benefit; and that on his own view
he ought to treat this as a late addition. On the contrary, he insists
that the &ldquo;evangelists&rdquo; could not have thought of adding it;
and that it makes an excellent climax if we take the healings to be
purely spiritual.</p>
<p class="par">The rational argument would be, of course, that the
first writer did make the Lord talk figuratively; and that a later
redactor, <i>taking the words literally</i>, added the item of the
poor, which he could not have done if he took them figuratively. But
the irreducible fallacy is the assumption that as a figurative claim
the speech is historic, one order of miracle being held allowable when
another is not. Schmiedel has exemplified his own saying that
&ldquo;with very few exceptions all critics fall into the very grave
error of immediately accepting a thing as true as soon as they have
found themselves able to trace it to a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>&lsquo;source&rsquo;.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3445src" href="#xd21e3445" name="xd21e3445src">5</a> It does
not in the least follow that by substituting spiritual for physical
miracle we acquire a right to claim historicity. And by the claim we
simply cancel the &ldquo;fame&rdquo; of the records.</p>
<p class="par">M. Loisy, committing himself to some acts of healing
where Schmiedel, after accepting the general claim, commits himself to
none, balances vaguely between acts of faith-healing so-called and
cures of sheer insanity, and accepts the tradition of</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">an unfruitful point at Nazareth.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3456src" href="#xd21e3456" name="xd21e3456src">6</a> &ldquo;A
prophet is not without honour, save in his own country and among his
own kin, and in his own house,&rdquo; Jesus had said before the
disdainful astonishment of his fellow-citizens and the incredulity of
his family; and he could work no miracle in that place.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">M. Loisy, it will be observed, here assumes that we are
dealing with real cures, and tacitly rejects the qualifying clauses in
<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%206:5">Mark vi,
5</a>, and <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2013:58">Matthew xiii,
58</a>, as he well may. They are indeed stamped with manipulation.
&ldquo;He could there do no mighty work <i>save that</i> he laid his
hands upon a few sick folk and healed them,&rdquo; says the first;
&ldquo;he did not <i>many</i> mighty works there because of their
unbelief,&rdquo; says the other. Such passages raise in an acute form
the question how <i>any</i> statement in the Gospels can reasonably be
taken as historical. What <i>were</i> the alleged mighty works done
elsewhere save acts of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href=
"#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>healing the sick? And how many
cases for such healing would naturally be presented by one small
hamlet? If, again, all the healings were spiritual, what are we left
with beyond the truism that <i>sinners</i> who did not believe were
unbelieving?</p>
<p class="par">As the modifications produce pure counter-sense, it is
critically permissible to surmise that they were lacking in the first
copies, and were inserted merely to guard against profane cavils. But
as the whole episode is found only in Matthew and Mark, it cannot
figure in Dr. Petrie&rsquo;s Nucleus; and for similar reasons it is
absent from the Primitive Gospel of the school of Bernhard Weiss. M.
Loisy, recognizing that it is the kind of item that Luke would avoid
for tactical reasons, is loyal enough to accept it as historical
without the modifying words, and seeks no better explanation than that
given in the cited words of Jesus.</p>
<p class="par">For those who aim at a rational comprehension of the
documents, the critical induction is that the story was inserted for a
reason; and the explanation which satisfies M. Loisy is so
ill-considered that it only emphasizes the need. A prophet is likely to
be looked at askance by his own people: yes, if he be an unimpressive
one; but upon what critical principles is M. Loisy entitled to assume,
as he constantly does, that the historic Jesus made a profound and
ineffaceable impression upon all who came in contact with him, from the
moment of his call to his disciples, and that nevertheless he had not
made the slightest impression of superiority upon his own kinsmen and
fellow-villagers, up to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>the age of thirty? How can such
propositions cohere? Jesus has only to leave Nazareth and to command
men to follow him, in order to be reverently recognized as a Superman:
for M. Loisy, it is his mere personality that creates the faith which,
after his death, makes his adherents proclaim him as a re-arisen God.
Is this the kind of personality that in an eastern village would be
known merely as that of &ldquo;the carpenter,&rdquo; or the
carpenter&rsquo;s son?</p>
<p class="par">M. Loisy, it is true, claims that Jesus had needed a
period of solitude and meditation in the desert to make him a teacher,
thus partly implying that before that experience the destined prophet
might not be recognizable as such. But is it a historic proposition
that the short time of solitude had worked a complete transformation?
Was a quite normal or commonplace personality capable of such a
transfiguration in a natural sense? That the critic had not even asked
himself the question is made plain by his complete failure to raise the
cognate question in regard to the marvellous healing powers with which
he unhesitatingly credits the teacher, on the strength of the wholly
supernaturalist testimony of the Gospels. These powers, according to M.
Loisy, were also the instantaneous result of the short period of
solitude in the desert. What pretensions can such a theory make to be
in conformity with historical principles? Cannot M. Loisy see that he
has only been miracle-mongering with a difference?</p>
<p class="par">It is bad enough that we should be asked to take
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>for granted, on the strength of a typically
Eastern record of wholesale thaumaturgy, a real &ldquo;natural&rdquo;
gift for healing a variety of nervous disorders. But a natural gift of
such a kind at least presupposes some process of development. M. Loisy
obliviously asks us to believe that all of a sudden a man who had
throughout his life shown no abnormal powers or qualities whatever,
began to exercise them upon the largest scale almost immediately after
he had left his native village. Now, whatever view be taken of the
cynical formula that a prophet has no honour in his own village, it is
idle to ask us to believe that a great healer has none. The local
healer of any sort has an easy opening; and the redacted Gospels
indicate uneasy recognition of the plain truth that Jesus needed only
to heal the sick at Nazareth as elsewhere to conquer unbelief. It was
precisely the cures that, in the Gospel story, had won him fame in the
surrounding country. M. Loisy has merely burked the problem.</p>
<p class="par">A little later he takes as historical the
&ldquo;terrible invectives&rdquo; pronounced against Capernaum and the
neighbouring cities, which he attempts to explain. After all, the
multitude had not gone beyond a &ldquo;benevolent curiosity, quite
ready to transform itself into an ironical incredulity. They had seen
the miracles; they awaited meantime the kingdom, without otherwise
preparing for it; and as the kingdom did not come they inclined less
and less to believe in it.&rdquo; So they were doomed to a terrible
judgment for their faithlessness. But why then was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>nothing said of the wholly unbelieving
Nazareth?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3518src" href="#xd21e3518" name=

<p class="par">Before such problems, the method of
&ldquo;liberal&rdquo; accommodation here as always breaks down. To the
eye of the evolutionist there is no great mystery. The avowal that the
Founder either <i>could not</i> or did not work wonders at Nazareth
might serve any one of several conceivable purposes. It might meet the
cavils of those who in a later day found and said that nothing was
known at Nazareth of a wonder-working Jesus who had dwelt there; even
as the often-repeated story of the command to healed persons to keep
silence could avail to turn the attacks of investigating doubters in
regard to the miraculous cures. Or it might serve either to impugn the
pretensions of those who at one stage of the movement called themselves
&ldquo;Nazarenes&rdquo; in the sense of followers of the man of
Nazareth, or to include the birthplace with the family and the
disciples in that disparagement of the Jewish surroundings which would
arise step for step with the spread of the Gentile movement. Any of
these explanations is reasonable beside the thesis that a man gifted
with marvellous healing powers, suddenly developed without any previous
sign of them, could either find no one in his own village to let him
try them, or to recognize them even when applied there, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>while the country round about, <i lang="la">ex
hypothesi</i>, was ringing with his fame. And the criticism which puts
us off with such solutions is really not well entitled to impute
&ldquo;superficiality&rdquo; to those who reject it.</p>
<p class="par">The whole &ldquo;carpenter&rdquo; story, in which M.
Loisy sees no difficulty, is one of the weakest of the Gospel attempts
at circumstantiality. A trade or calling for the Messiah, as a true
Jew, was perhaps as requisite in the eyes of some Jews as either a
Davidic descent or an argument to prove that Davidic descent was for
the Messiah unnecessary&mdash;<i>both</i> of which requirements the
Gospels meet. Every good Jew, we are told, was required to have a
handicraft or profession. A &ldquo;Ben-Joseph,&rdquo; again, was
called-for to meet the requirement, common among the Samaritans but not
confined to them, of a Messiah so named.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3542src" href="#xd21e3542" name="xd21e3542src">8</a> But how came
it that &ldquo;the carpenter&rdquo; of Mark is only &ldquo;the
carpenter&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153"
name="pb153">153</a>]</span>son&rdquo; in Matthew? We can conceive the
Gentilizing Luke putting both statements aside as ill-suited to his
purpose, his Jesus being a God competing with Gentile Gods; but if
there really was an early knowledge that Jesus was a carpenter, why
should Matthew minimize it? And how came it that Origen<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3566src" href="#xd21e3566" name="xd21e3566src">9</a>
knew of no Gospel &ldquo;current in the churches&rdquo; in which Jesus
was described as a carpenter?</p>
<p class="par">In this matter, as about the Infancy generally, the
apocryphal gospels are as rich in detail as the canonical are poor.
Again and again does Joseph figure in them as a working carpenter, or
plough-maker, or house-builder.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3573src"
href="#xd21e3573" name="xd21e3573src">10</a> The words of Origen might
imply that it was from some such source that Celsus drew his statement
that Jesus was a carpenter; and yet none of the preserved apocrypha
speaks of Jesus as working at carpentry save by way of such miracles as
that of the elongation of the piece of wood. Having regard to the
mythical aspect of the whole, we suggest an easily misinterpreted
Gnostic source for the basis. For some schools of the Gnostics, the
Jewish God was the <i>Demiourgos</i>, the Artisan or Creator, a
subordinate being in their divine hierarchy. The word could mean an
artisan of any kind; and <i>architector</i>, the term in the Latin
version of Thomas, points to a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154"
href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>reflex of the idea of
&ldquo;creator&rdquo; which attached to the Gnostic term.</p>
<p class="par">That the doctrine of the <i>Demiourgos</i> was already
current in Jewish circles before the period commonly assigned to
Christian Gnosticism has been shown with much probability by Dr. S.
Karppe. In a Talmudic passage given as cited by Rabbi Jochanan ben
Saccai before the middle of the first century, <span class=
"sc">C.E.</span>, there is denunciation of those who &ldquo;spare not
the glory of the Creator&rdquo;; and other passages interpret this in
the sense of a heresy which &ldquo;diminishes God&rdquo; and
&ldquo;sows division between Israel and his God.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3619src" href="#xd21e3619" name=
"xd21e3619src">11</a> Debate of this kind emerges with the name of the
Jud&aelig;o-Christian heretic Cerinthus. For him, Jesus, though
naturally born, was entered at his baptism by Christ, the son not of
the Jewish God, the Demiourgos, but of the Supreme God.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3625src" href="#xd21e3625" name=
"xd21e3625src">12</a> There might well be, however, round Cerinthus,
who retained Jewish leanings, Jews who held to the
Jud&aelig;o-Christian primary position that Jesus was the son of
Yahweh. By some early Gnostics he could hardly fail to be so named.
Could not then the Gnostic &ldquo;Son of the Demiourgos,&rdquo; the
Artificer, become for more literal Christists &ldquo;son of the
carpenter,&rdquo; even as the mystic seamless robe of Pagan myth became
for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>some a garment which had to be cut in pieces to
be divided?</p>
<p class="par">Met by such suggestions, M. Loisy tells us that we are
superficial. But is he otherwise? Is he not simply evading his problem?
Can he see nothing strange in the sudden mention of the carpenter in a
&ldquo;primary&rdquo; gospel which had set out with a divine personage
and had never mentioned his parents or upbringing? On the mythic theory
the apparition of the Messiah without antecedents is precisely what was
to be expected; if there was any clear Jewish expectation on the point,
it was that he should come unlooked for, unheralded save, on one view,
by &ldquo;Elias.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3647src" href=
"#xd21e3647" name="xd21e3647src">13</a> Thus the Gospel record fits
into the myth theory from the outset, while on the assumption of
historicity it is but a series of enigmas.</p>
<p class="par">Holding by that assumption, M. Loisy is forced to
violent measures to reconcile the isolated Marcan mention of &ldquo;the
son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon&rdquo;
with the repeated mentions in the closing chapters of (1) &ldquo;Mary
the mother of James the less and of Joses and Salome; <i>who when he
was in Galilee followed</i> [Jesus] <i>and ministered unto
him</i>&rdquo;; (2) &ldquo;Mary the mother of Joses&rdquo;; and (3)
&ldquo;Mary the mother of James and Salome.&rdquo; In these closing
chapters this Mary the mother of James and Joses and Salome figures
first <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>as simply one who followed and ministered to
Jesus, then as the mother of Joses, then as the mother of James and
Salome, but <i>never</i> as the mother of Jesus. By what right does M.
Loisy extract his certitude from the prior text?</p>
<p class="par">His simple course is to decide that Mary the mother of
James and of Joses and of Salome in the closing chapters is <i>not</i>
Mary the mother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon in chapter vi.
&ldquo;Certain Fathers,&rdquo; he had noted in his great work on the
Synoptics (citing in particular Chrysostom), &ldquo;desirous of making
the synoptics accord with John, identify Mary the mother of James and
Joses [in ch. xv] with the mother of Jesus; but it is evident that if
the synoptics had thought of the mother of the Saviour they would not
have thus designated her.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3683src"
href="#xd21e3683" name="xd21e3683src">14</a> Precisely! And if the
Gospel of Mark in its original form had contained the passage in
chapter vi, how could it possibly have spoken in chapter xv of a Mary
the mother of James and Joses without indicating either that she was or
was not the same Mary? Would it have deliberately specified two Maries,
each the mother of a James and a Joses, without a word of
differentiation?</p>
<p class="par">To the faithful critic there is only one course open. He
is bound to conclude that the passage in chapter vi is a late
interpolation, the work of an inventor who had perhaps either accepted
or anticipated the Johannine record that Mary the mother <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>of
Jesus was present at the crucifixion, but who did not&mdash;perhaps in
his copy of Mark could not&mdash;completely carry out his purpose by
making the Mary at the crucifixion the mother of the crucified
Lord.</p>
<p class="par">We are not here concerned with the exegesis of those
Fathers who desired to save the perpetual virginity of Mary; our
business is simply with the texts. And we can but say that if, with M.
Loisy, we make the Mary of chapter xv another Mary than her of chapter
vi, we are bound on the same principle to find a third and a fourth
Mary in &ldquo;the mother of Joses&rdquo; (xv, 47) and the
&ldquo;mother of James and Salome&rdquo; (xvi, 1).<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3694src" href="#xd21e3694" name="xd21e3694src">15</a> It will
really not do. The mythological theory, which traces the mourning
Maries to an ancient liturgy of a God-sacrifice and finds the
mother-Mary of chapter vi an alien element, may seem to M. Loisy
superficial, but it meets a problem which he simply evades.</p>
<p class="par">The only serious difficulties for M. Loisy, apparently,
are the miracles and the prophecies. On the latter he makes no use of
the Savonarola argument; and in his smaller work he ignores the
&ldquo;rock&rdquo; text; but for him &ldquo;the scene of C&aelig;sarea
Philippi, with the Messianic confession of Peter, seems thoroughly
historic&rdquo;; and on the other hand the story of Peter&rsquo;s
denial of his Master causes him no misgiving. For a rational reader,
the conception <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>of the shamed Peter figuring soon afterwards as
the merciless judge and supernatural slayer of the unhappy Ananias is
extremely indigestible. The personage thus evolved is not only
detestable but incredible. How could the coward apostle figure
primarily and continuously as a pillar of the Church described?
Harnack&rsquo;s method, as Professor Blass complains,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3723src" href="#xd21e3723" name="xd21e3723src">16</a> treats
the denigration of Peter as the result of the strife between the
Judaizing and the Gentilizing sections of the early Church; it is the
natural hypothesis. Without it we are left to the detestable and
impossible figure of the apostle who denies his Lord and has no mercy
for a weak brother who merely keeps back part of a sum of money when
professing freely to donate the whole. The critical reader will prefer
to follow Harnack.</p>
<p class="par">But if we give up the story of the Denial, how shall we
retain those which exalt and glorify the Judaizing apostle? If we give
up Matthew&rsquo;s &ldquo;rock&rdquo; texts, with what consistency can
we take as pure history the episode in Mark in which Peter, first of
the twelve, declares &ldquo;Thou art the Christ,&rdquo; eliciting the
charge to &ldquo;tell no man of him,&rdquo; followed by the prediction
of death and resurrection, spoken &ldquo;openly&rdquo;? The episode in
Mark passes into, and in Matthew is followed by, the fierce rebuke to
the expostulating Peter, &ldquo;Get thee behind me, Satan, for thou
mindest not the things of God, but the things of men&rdquo;&mdash;a
strange sequel to Matthew&rsquo;s &ldquo;Blessed art thou, Simon
Bar-Jonah; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto
thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This is one of the passages that force the conclusion
either that &ldquo;Mark&rdquo; had before him the fuller record, in
&ldquo;Matthew&rdquo; or elsewhere, and turned it from a Petrine to an
anti-Petrine purpose, or that a redactor did so. There is no escape
from the evidence that we are dealing with two sharply conflicting
constructions. The &ldquo;Blessed art thou&rdquo; passage and the
&ldquo;Satan&rdquo; passage will not cohere. Which came first? Had
&ldquo;Luke&rdquo; either before him? <i>His</i> &ldquo;Get thee behind
me, Satan&rdquo; (iv, 8; A.V.), addressed to the devil in the
Temptation, is ejected from the revised text as being absent from most
of the ancient codices; and its presence in the Alexandrine suggests an
attempt to get in <i>somewhere</i> a saying which otherwise had no
place in the third Gospel. The absence alike of the blessing and the
aspersion on Peter sets up the surmise that both are quite late, and
that the insertion of one elicited the other.</p>
<p class="par">Again and again we find in the Gospels such traces of a
strife over Petrine pretensions. In the story of the Denial, which we
have found so incompatible with the attitude ascribed to Peter in the
Acts, everyone since Strauss has recognized a process of redaction and
interpolation. M. Loisy, saying nothing of the central problem,
avowedly finds in Mark &ldquo;a manipulation, deliberate and
ill-managed, of a more simple statement.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3742src" href="#xd21e3742" name="xd21e3742src">17</a> This might
have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>sufficed to put him on his guard; but all he has
to say, after reducing the confused details to the inferred
&ldquo;simpler statement,&rdquo; is that &ldquo;<i>if</i> there is in
any part of the second Gospel a personal recollection of Peter it is
the story of the denial in the form in which Mark found
it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3752src" href="#xd21e3752" name=
"xd21e3752src">18</a> Which makes sad havoc of the Peter-Mark
tradition; for the story of the denial betrays itself as a late
anti-Petrine invention, as aforesaid. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

in pointing to this detail in Jewish Messianism (<i lang="de">Das Leben

on the score that there are no certain traces of it before the
Babylonian <i>Gemara</i>, the compilation of which took place in the
Christian era, and the book <i>Sohar</i>, of which the age is doubtful.
Principal Drummond (<i>The Jewish Messiah</i>, 1877, p. 357) further
agreed, with Gfr&ouml;rer, that the doctrine of a Messiah Ben-Joseph is
extremely unlikely to have been pre-Christian. The obvious answer is
that it is overwhelmingly unlikely to have been post-Christian! But
that thesis is apparently not now maintained even by orthodox scholars.

historical problems, M. Loisy is of necessity accommodating when he
faces those which he recognizes to be central. Over the story of the
&ldquo;purification&rdquo; of the temple&mdash;which Origen found at
once unjustifiable and signally miraculous, since it was inconceivable
that so great a multitude should have yielded to the mere attack of one
man with a scourge of small cords&mdash;he has again no misgivings. He
feels that some such story was needed to motive the priestly action
against Jesus.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3767src" href="#xd21e3767"
name="xd21e3767src">1</a> In the story of the astonishing sophism
ascribed to Jesus on the subject of the tribute to C&aelig;sar he sees
only &ldquo;cleverness&rdquo; (<i lang="fr">habilet&eacute;</i>); and
yet he accepts as historical&mdash;again by necessity of his
thesis&mdash;Jesus&rsquo;s admission that he claimed to be king of the
Jews. In the story of the betrayal he sees fit, docilely following
Brandt, to allege &ldquo;a little confused fighting, some blows given
and received&rdquo; over and above the cutting off of the ear of
Malchus, an imagined item which he finds in none of the Gospels. Over
the prayers of the Lord while the disciples slept he had hesitated in
his commentary;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3775src" href="#xd21e3775"
name="xd21e3775src">2</a> falling back on the notable avowal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>that &ldquo;the sort of incoherence which
results from describing a scene which passed while the witnesses [!]
were asleep is <i>without doubt</i> to be explained <i>by the origin
and character of the narrative rather than by a negligence of the
narrator</i>.&rdquo; For once, I unreservedly assent to the <i lang=
"fr">sans doute</i>. Quite unwittingly, M. Loisy has put himself in
line with our mythical theory, which postulates a drama as the origin
of the narrative.</p>
<p class="par">All the same, he accepts the narrative as history; and
he sees nothing in the fusion of the two speeches: &ldquo;Sleep on....
It is enough.... Arise now,&rdquo;... though he rejects the proposal of
Bleek, Volkmar, and Wellhausen to turn &ldquo;Sleep on&rdquo; into an
interrogation,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3794src" href="#xd21e3794"
name="xd21e3794src">3</a> and admits that the &ldquo;It is
enough&rdquo; is an &ldquo;unclear and very insufficient
transition&rdquo; from &ldquo;Sleep on&rdquo; to &ldquo;Arise.&rdquo;
Once more, which is the more superficial, this lame handling or the
recognition of a transcribed drama with two speeches combined because
of the omission of an exit and an entrance, in what M. Loisy admits to
be &ldquo;a highly dramatic <i lang="fr">mise en
sc&egrave;ne</i>&rdquo;?</p>
<p class="par">But it is over the trial in the house of the high priest
that M. Loisy most astonishingly redacts the narrative. In his
commentary he recognizes that Matthew&rsquo;s story, in which the
scribes and the elders are &ldquo;already gathered together&rdquo; in
the dead of night when Jesus is brought for trial, and the story of
Mark, in which they &ldquo;come together with&rdquo; the high priest,
are equally incredible; and that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>story of the quest
for witnesses in the night is still more so.</p>
<p class="par">Once again we have a <i lang="fr">sans doute</i> with
which we can agree. &ldquo;The nocturnal procedure, no doubt, did not
take place.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3811src" href=
"#xd21e3811" name="xd21e3811src">4</a> Recognizing further that a
Jewish blasphemer was by the Levitical law to be stoned, not crucified,
he simply gives up the whole narrative as a product of &ldquo;the
Christian tradition,&rdquo; bent on saddling the Jews rather than the
Romans with the responsibility of the crucifixion.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3816src" href="#xd21e3816" name="xd21e3816src">5</a> In his
smaller work he simply cuts the knot and alleges:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;As soon as the first daylight had come
(<i lang="fr">d&egrave;s les premiers lueurs du jour</i>), a reunion
was held at the house of (<i lang="fr">chez</i>) the chief
priest,&rdquo; where it was without doubt [!] arranged that they should
content themselves with denouncing the Galilean prophet to the Roman
authority as a disturber and a false Messiah. But it was necessary to
arrange the terms of the accusation and distribute the r&ocirc;les, to
get together and prepare the witnesses. <i>These measures were soon
taken. As soon as morning had come</i> (<i lang="fr">d&egrave;s le
matin</i>) the priests brought their prisoner chained before the
tribunal of Pontius Pilate.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3836src" href=
"#xd21e3836" name="xd21e3836src">6</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">One certainly cannot call this manipulation of the texts
&ldquo;superficial.&rdquo; It is sheer deliberate dissolution and
reconstruction of the narrative, by way of substituting something more
plausible for the incredible original, when all the while the
credibility of the original is the thesis maintained. And yet even the
reconstruction is so thoughtlessly managed that we get only a slightly
less impossible account. Only a scholar who never followed the details
of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>legal process could suggest that the task of
hunting up witnesses and arranging a procedure could be carried through
between &ldquo;earliest dawn&rdquo; and &ldquo;morning.&rdquo; And for
the headlong haste of such a procedure, only an hour or so after the
arrest of the prisoner, no explanation is even suggested. A violent
impossibility in the record, destructive of all faith in its
historicity at this point, is sought to be saved by a violent redaction
which simply &ldquo;makes hay&rdquo; of the very documents founded on.
And this illicit violence is resorted to because M. Loisy recognizes
that if he is to retain a historical Jesus at all he must bring the
whole trial story into a historical shape. He certainly had cause to
take drastic measures. Long ago it was pointed out that by Jewish law a
prisoner must not be condemned to death on the day of his trial:
<i lang="la">Judicia de capitalibus finiunt eodem die si sint ad
absolutionem; si vero sint ad damnationem, finiuntur die
sequente</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3848src" href="#xd21e3848"
name="xd21e3848src">7</a> This might alone suffice to &ldquo;bring into
doubt&rdquo; the priestly trial; to say nothing of the modern Jewish
protest that a capital prosecution and execution on either the day
after or the day of the Passover, at the instance of the High Priest,
was unthinkable.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3851src" href="#xd21e3851"
name="xd21e3851src">8</a> There were good reasons, then, for seeking to
found on the trial before Pilate.</p>
<p class="par">Let us now survey broadly the process of historical
criticism thus far. 1. At an early stage the reconstructors gave up as
pure fiction the third trial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href=
"#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>before Herod, which appears solely
in Luke. They did not ask what historical knowledge, or what sense of
history, can have existed in a community among which such an absolute
invention found ready currency. 2. The next step was to reject as
&ldquo;unhistorical&rdquo; the narrative of the fourth Gospel, in which
Jesus (<i>a</i>) is examined by Annas the high priest, but in no sense
tried; (<i>b</i>) is then sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest;
(<i>c</i>) is immediately passed on from Caiaphas to Pilate, who
examines him within doors while the priests remain outside, there being
thus no Jewish witnesses; (<i>d</i>) tells Pilate &ldquo;My kingdom is
not of this world,&rdquo; and convinces him that he is not punishable.
Rejecting this account, as they well might, the reconstructors failed
to ask themselves what such an invention signifies. 3. Next disappears
the so-called historical narrative of the trial before the high priest
and chief priests in the synoptics.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3876src"
href="#xd21e3876" name="xd21e3876src">9</a> That in turn, taken on its
merits, is found flagrantly incredible; and now M. Loisy in effect puts
it aside, reducing it to a fundamentally different form.</p>
<p class="par">Three of the trial stories are thus in turn rejected as
hopelessly unhistorical. And now we are invited to regard as
&ldquo;incontestable&rdquo; the fourth, the trial before Pilate as
related in the synoptics; the Johannine version being dismissed as
fiction. In the scientific sense of the word<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3884src" href="#xd21e3884" name="xd21e3884src">10</a> the
rejected stories <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166"
name="pb166">166</a>]</span>have been classed as myths. And still we
are told that the &ldquo;myth-theory&rdquo; is outside discussion.</p>
<p class="par">Yet, even in coming to the trial before Pilate, M. Loisy
has to begin by noting the improbability that the entire sanhedrim
should have attended it, as is alleged by the synoptics. &ldquo;In the
minds of the evangelists the sanhedrim represents the Jews, and it was
the Jews who caused the death of Jesus. Hence the general expressions
which the redactors used the more willingly because they were very
incompletely informed on the facts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3900src" href="#xd21e3900" name="xd21e3900src">11</a> Still, the
trial must stand good. Judas goes the way of myth; but the
unintelligible procedure of Pilate must be salved. With his general
loyalty to the facts as he sees them M. Loisy notes, with Brandt, that
in the synoptics as in John there is no Jesuist eye-witness or auditor
to report for the faithful what took place. &ldquo;Here begin the gaps
in the Passion-history,&rdquo; remarks Brandt.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3905src" href="#xd21e3905" name="xd21e3905src">12</a>
&ldquo;Tradition could learn only by indirect ways the general features
of the interrogation and the principal incidents which passed between
the morning of Friday and the hour of the crucifixion,&rdquo; says
Loisy.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3910src" href="#xd21e3910" name=
"xd21e3910src">13</a> The student really concerned to get at history is
compelled to pronounce that the record thus avowed to be mainly
guesswork is myth. Let us take the report as we have it in <a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mk%2015:1-5">Mark</a>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">And straightway [after the condemnation by the
priests] in the morning the chief priests, with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>elders and scribes and the whole council, held a
consultation, and bound Jesus and carried him away, and delivered him
up to Pilate. And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And
he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.... And Pilate again asked
him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse
thee of. But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate
marvelled.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">To this meagre record, in which a capital case is
carried before the governor without the slightest documentary
preliminaries, and in which he begins to interrogate before a word has
been said about the indictment, Matthew adds nothing save the story of
Pilate&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s dream, which the reconstructors are fain to
dismiss; while Luke, who sees fit to premise specific charges of
anti-Roman sedition, follows them up simply by Pilate&rsquo;s question
and Jesus&rsquo;s assenting answer; and then, quite unintelligibly,
makes Pilate declare &ldquo;unto the chief priests and the multitudes,
I find no fault in this man.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">What can it mean? All the exegetes now agree that the
&ldquo;Thou sayest&rdquo; of Jesus has the force of &ldquo;I
am.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3929src" href="#xd21e3929" name=
"xd21e3929src">14</a> By avowing that he called himself King of the
Jews he committed a very grave offence towards Rome, unless he
explained the title in a mystic sense; and the records exclude any such
explanation. In Mark and Matthew the effect is the same: Pilate finds
no guilt, and proposes release; but yields to the multitude and the
priests. Could any serious student bring himself to regard this as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>history unless he presupposed the historicity of
the crucifixion and was ready to let pass any semblance of motivation
for it?</p>
<p class="par">Once more we must affirm that the documents merely
reveal entire ignorance of any judicial procedure. Pilate finally puts
to death a Jewish prisoner at the request of the sanhedrim and the
multitude on a charge for which he finds no evidence. That Pilate
should make light of a Jew&rsquo;s life is indeed easily to be
believed: he is exhibited to us by Josephus as an entirely ruthless
Roman; but both the synoptics and the fourth Gospel present him in an
entirely different light; and no record or commentary makes it
intelligible that the Roman governor should crucify a politically
unoffending Jew for a purely ecclesiastical Jewish offence. The offence
against Rome he is expressly represented as finding imaginary; and yet
on the other hand the offence as avowed is very real. By the method of
mere accommodation or partial critical rationalism the ascription of
the prosecution to the Jews is accounted for as the result of the later
developed anti-Judaism of the Christians. But on that view what
historical basis have we left? If the later Christians could invent the
trial and the Resurrection, what was to prevent their inventing the
crucifixion? M. Loisy admits that if the trial goes the historicity of
Jesus goes with it; then the crucifixion becomes myth. To say that this
is impossible is to beg the question: the myth theory offers the
solution.</p>
<p class="par">Given the datum of an original cult-sacrament
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>which had grown out of an ancient
ritual-sacrifice, the crucifixion is the first step towards the
establishment of a biography of Jesus. A trial and a condemnation,
again, are necessary preliminaries to that; and when we critically
examine these we find that they are patently unhistorical. Upon no
theory of historicity can their contradictions and impossibilities be
explained. Once we make the hypothesis, however, that the crucifixion
is itself myth, the imbroglio becomes intelligible.</p>
<p class="par">What we do know historically is that the early
Christists included Judaizers and Gentilizers; this is established by
the sect-history, apart from the Acts and the Epistles. For the
Judaizers an execution by the Romans was necessary; for the
Gentilizers, who were bound to guard against official Roman resentment,
and whose hostility to the Jews was progressive, a Jewish prosecution
was equally necessary. In the surviving mystery-play, predominantly a
Gentile performance as it now stands in the Gospels, an impossible
Jewish trial is followed by an equally impossible Roman trial, in which
Jesus by doctrinal necessity avows that he is King of the Jews, thereby
salving his Messiahship; while, to keep the guilt on Jewish shoulders
and to exclude the suspicion of anti-Roman bias, Pilate is made to
disclaim all responsibility. Such is, briefly, the outcome of the myth
theory. Upon what other theory can the documents be explained?</p>
<p class="par">Upon what other theory, again, can we explain the vast
contrast between the triumphal entry into Jerusalem a few days before
and the absolute <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170"
name="pb170">170</a>]</span>unanimity of the priest-led multitude in
demanding the execution of Jesus against the wish of Pilate? The
reconstructors accept both items, with arbitrary modifications, as
historical; though the story of the entry is preceded by a mythical
item about the choice of the ass-foal whereon never man had
sat,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3963src" href="#xd21e3963" name=
"xd21e3963src">15</a> which is much more stressed and developed than
the main point. We are asked to believe that Jesus on his entry is
enthusiastically acclaimed by a great multitude as Son of David and
King of Israel; and that a few days later not a voice is raised to save
his life. Gentilizing Christians could easily credit such things of the
Jews. Can a historical student do so? For the former it was enough that
in the narrative the Messiahship of the Lord had been publicly
accepted; coherence was not required. But historicity means
coherence.</p>
<p class="par">Last of all, the item of Barabbas, one of the elaborate
irrelevancies which leap to the eye in a narrative so destitute of
essentials, turns out to carry a curious corroboration to the
myth-theory. This is not the place to develop the probable kinship of
the Barabbas of the Gospels with the (misspelt) Karabbas<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3971src" href="#xd21e3971" name=
"xd21e3971src">16</a> of Philo; but we may note the probable reason for
the introduction of the name into the myth. As the story stands, it
serves merely to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171"
name="pb171">171</a>]</span>heighten the guilt of the Jews, making them
in mass save the life of a murderer rather than that of the divine
Saviour. The whole story is plainly unhistorical: &ldquo;neither these
details nor those which follow,&rdquo; remarks M. Loisy (after noting
the &ldquo;extremely vague indications under an appearance of
precision&rdquo; in regard to the antecedents of Barabbas), &ldquo;seem
discussible from the point of view of history.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3982src" href="#xd21e3982" name="xd21e3982src">17</a> In point
of fact, Pilate is made to release an ostensible ringleader of
&ldquo;men who in <i>the</i> insurrection [unspecified] had committed
murder,&rdquo; thus making his action doubly inconceivable. Why was
such an item introduced at all?</p>
<p class="par">It is not a case for very confident explanation; but
when we note that Barabbas means &ldquo;Son of the Father&rdquo;; that
the Karabbas of Philo is treated as a mock-king; and that the reading
&ldquo;Jesus Barabbas&rdquo; in Matt, xxvii, 16, 17, was long the
accepted one in the ancient church,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3992src"
href="#xd21e3992" name="xd21e3992src">18</a> we are strongly led to
infer (1) that the formula &ldquo;Jesus the Son of the Father&rdquo;
was <i>well known</i> among the first Christians as being connected
with a popular rite&mdash;else how could such a strange perplexity be
introduced into the text?&mdash;and (2) that the real reason for
introducing it was that those anti-Christians who knew of the name and
rite in question used their knowledge against the faith. The way to
rebut them was to present Jesus Barabbas not only as a murderer but as
the man actually released to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href=
"#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>the Jewish people instead of Jesus
the Christ, proposed to be released by Pilate.</p>
<p class="par">Again, then, on the mythical theory, we find a meaning
and a sane solution where the historical theory can offer none. Sir
James Frazer&rsquo;s hypothesis that the story of the triumphal entry
may preserve a tradition of a mock-royal procession for a destined
victim is only a partial solution; and his further hypothesis of a
strangely ignored <i>coincidence</i> between a Barabbas rite and the
actual crucifixion of the Christian &ldquo;Son of the Father&rdquo; is
but a sacrifice of mythological principle to the assumption of
historicity. The conception of Jesus as sacrificed lies at the core of
early Christian cult-propaganda. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173"

<h2 class="main">THE JESUS-FIGURE OF M. LOISY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is the same, finally, with the story of the
original evangel as with the story of the tragedy; M. Loisy fails to
come within sight of historicity in the one case as in the other.
Having fallen back on the thesis, so popularized by Renan, that faith
in the necessary resurrection of the Messiah created the legend of the
empty tomb and the divine apparitions, he proceeds to formulate the
Teaching which had created the faith. The historic creed of
Christianity is thus figured as a pyramid poised on the apex of a
hallucination; but we are assured that the hallucination resulted from
the greatness of the Personality of the slain Teacher.</p>
<p class="par">Taking no note of any other conception of a possible
origination of the cult, M. Loisy pronounces that to explain it we must
hold that the &ldquo;group of adherents&rdquo; had before the
crucifixion evolved a &ldquo;religious life&rdquo; sufficiently deep to
sustain the feeling that the death of the Master was an accident,
&ldquo;grave no doubt [!] and perturbing, but
reparable&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4020src" href="#xd21e4020"
name="xd21e4020src">1</a> and to explain this religious life he goes
back to the Master&rsquo;s doctrine. And the moment he begins his
exposition he vacillates anew over the old dilemma:&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Jesus pursued a work, <i>not</i> the propagation
of a belief; he did <i>not</i> explain theoretically the Kingdom of
Heaven, he prepared its coming by exhorting men to repent.
<i>Nevertheless</i> even the work of Jesus attaches itself to the idea
of the celestial kingdom; it defines itself in that idea, which
presupposes, implies, or involves with it other ideas. It is this
combination of ideas familiar to Christ that we must reconstruct with
the help of the Gospels.... The idea of the kingdom of God is, in a
sense, all the Gospel; but it is also all Judaism....<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4038src" href="#xd21e4038" name="xd21e4038src">2</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Exactly. Jesus, in effect, preached just what the
Baptist is said to have preached; only without baptism. The monition to
repent was simply the monition of all the prophets and all the
eschatologists; and it had not the attraction of baptism which the
evangel of the Baptist was said to have. So that the Twelve, on the
showing of M. Loisy, went through Jewry uttering only one familiar
phrase&mdash;and casting out devils&mdash;and dooming those who refused
to hear them. And, by their own report, it was in casting out devils
that they had their success. The simple <i>name</i> of Jesus, according
to the Gospels, availed for that where he had never appeared in person.
Yet, again, the name is used by non-adherents for the same purpose
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%209:38">Mk. ix,
38</a>). And still M. Loisy confidently claims that there is no trace
of a pre-Christian Jesus cult in Palestine!<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4051src" href="#xd21e4051" name="xd21e4051src">3</a></p>
<p class="par">Concerning the nullity of the original evangel he is
quite unwittingly explicit when he is resisting the myth theory; albeit
in the act of contradicting himself:&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Paul, indeed, proclaims [<i>se r&eacute;clame
du</i>] an immortal Christ, or more exactly a Christ dead and
re-arisen, <i>not the Jesus preaching the evangel in Galilee and at
Jerusalem</i>. But his attitude is easy to explain.... He was aware of
the circumstances of the death of Christ, and of what was preached by
his followers.... If he boasted of having learned nothing from the old
[<i>sic</i>] apostles, it was that, in reality, he had never been at
their school.... But he was able [<i lang="fr">il lui arrive</i>] also
to affirm the conformity of his teaching with theirs: that is what he
did in the passage ... touching the death and resurrection of Jesus.
Paul converted had nothing to demand of the first apostles of Jesus,
because he knew already what they had preached.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4074src" href="#xd21e4074" name="xd21e4074src">4</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">So that the doctrine of an immortal or resurrected
Christ was the sole doctrine of the Apostles. There was no other
evangel. And this doctrine, which had just been declared to be born of
the <i>personal</i> impression made by Jesus on his followers, is also
the doctrine of Paul, who had never seen Jesus.</p>
<p class="par">The primary evangel having thus simply disappeared, we
revert to the Jesuine Teaching (addressed in large part only to the
disciples) which had formed among disciples and adherents such a
&ldquo;religious life&rdquo; as served to develop the conviction that
the Master could not really die, and so prepared the foundation upon
which Paul built historic Christianity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4086src" href="#xd21e4086" name="xd21e4086src">5</a> We have seen
how M. Loisy vacillates over the Founder&rsquo;s conception of the
Kingdom of God in relation to his moral teaching. When it is a question
of a myth theory, M. Loisy insists upon exactitude. &ldquo;In order
that the thesis should be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href=
"#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>sustainable, it would be necessary
that a <i>well-defined</i> myth should have existed in some Jewish
sect.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4096src" href="#xd21e4096"
name="xd21e4096src">6</a> But there is no call for well-defined proofs
or notions when it is a question of defending the tradition. For our
critic, Jesus is first and foremost an intense believer in a miraculous
advent of that Kingdom which had come simply to mean &ldquo;the
sovereignty of God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4101src" href=
"#xd21e4101" name="xd21e4101src">7</a> Even this conception is of
necessity vague to the last degree:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The primitive nationalism subsisted at least in
the framework [<i lang="fr">cadre</i>] and the exterior economy of the
kingdom of God; it maintained itself also in [<i lang="fr">jusque
dans</i>] the evangel of Jesus. At the same time the kingdom of God is
not a simple moral reform, to safeguard the law of the celestial
Sovereign and guarantee the happiness of the faithful. The action of
Yahweh ... governs the entire universe.... [The cosmological tradition]
developed the idea of a definite triumph of light over darkness, of
order over chaos, a triumph which was to be the final victory of good
over evil.... The terrestrial kingdoms ... were to disappear, to give
place to the reign of Israel, which was the reign of the just, the
reign of God. In this great instauration of the divine order, in this
regeneration of the universe, the divine justice was to manifest itself
by the resurrection of all the true faithful.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4123src" href="#xd21e4123" name="xd21e4123src">8</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">This transformation, then&mdash;the long current dream
of Jewry&mdash;was to be a vast miracle, and in that miracle Jesus
believed he was to play the part of the Messiah, the divine
representative. That expectation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177"
href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>sustained him till the moment
of his death.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4132src" href="#xd21e4132"
name="xd21e4132src">9</a> Nevertheless &ldquo;his idea of the reign of
God was not a patriotic hallucination <i>or the dream of an excited</i>
[<i lang="fr">exalt&eacute;</i>] <i>mystic</i>. The reign of God is the
reign of justice.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4147src" href=
"#xd21e4147" name="xd21e4147src">10</a> (As if the second sentence
proved the first.) And yet, all the while: &ldquo;On the whole, the
Gospel ethic is no more consistent than the hope of the kingdom....
Considered in themselves, as the Gospel makes them known to us, <i>they
are not mythic but mystic</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4157src" href="#xd21e4157" name="xd21e4157src">11</a></p>
<p class="par">Thus helped to a definite conception, we turn to the
ethic, which we have seen to be in the main a compilation from Jewish
literature. This fact M. Loisy admits, only to deny that it has any
significance:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">He opposes the voice of his conscience to the
tradition of the doctors. There lies precisely the originality of his
teaching, which, if one recomposed the materials piece by piece, could
be found scattered in the Biblical writings or in the sayings of the
rabbis. <i>Like every man who speaks to men, Jesus takes his ideas in
the common treasure of his environment and his time</i>; but as to what
he makes of it [<i lang="fr">pour le parti qu&rsquo;il en tire</i>] one
does not say that it proceeds from any one. This independence results,
probably, at once from his character and from the circumstances of his
education.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4173src" href="#xd21e4173" name=
"xd21e4173src">12</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Thus, as regards the Sermon on the Mount, the act of
collecting a number of ethical precepts and maxims from the current
literature and lore of one&rsquo;s people and curtly enouncing them,
without <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>development, is a proof of supreme moral
originality, and is to be regarded as opposing the voice of one&rsquo;s
conscience to tradition. Had the rabbis, then, no conscience? Was their
ethic a mere tradition, even when they gave out or originated the
maxims of the Sermon on the Mount? Was Hillel but a mouth-piece of the
law? M. Loisy must in justice pardon us for avowing that so far he has
but duplicated a worn-out paralogism, and that he has evaded the plain
documentary fact that the Sermon is a literary compilation,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4182src" href="#xd21e4182" name=
"xd21e4182src">13</a> and not a discourse at all.</p>
<p class="par">And when we turn to specific teachings, his commentary
does but compel us to ask how the teaching which he insists upon taking
as genuinely uttered by the Teacher can be associated with the
Messianist he has been describing. Accepting as genuine the story of
the woman taken in adultery, now bracketed in the English Revised
Version as being absent from the most ancient manuscripts, but
presumably found in the lost Gospel of the Hebrews,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4194src" href="#xd21e4194" name="xd21e4194src">14</a> he
remarks that &ldquo;the elect of the kingdom must not use marriage;
they were to be as the angels in heaven&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4202src" href="#xd21e4202" name="xd21e4202src">15</a> and at the
same time he describes the veto on divorce as &ldquo;a trait so
personal to the teaching of Christ, and so difficult to comprehend if
one denies all originality to that teaching.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4207src" href="#xd21e4207" name="xd21e4207src">16</a> That is
to say, the believer in the speedy end of all marriage relations, and
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>establishment of a new and angelic life for all
who survive, occupied himself earnestly with the restriction or
abolition of divorce!</p>
<p class="par">At other junctures M. Loisy is ready to see how the
doctrines of sections and movements in the later Christian Church were
introduced into the Gospels. He will not admit of such an explanation
here. Does he then see a supreme moral inspiration in the Montanists
and other Christian sectaries who set their faces against the sexual
instinct? Has he forgotten the text in Malachi (ii, 14&ndash;16),
vetoing a heartless divorce? And has he never heard of the saying of
Rabbi Eliezer, echoed elsewhere in the Talmud, that the altar sheds
tears over him who puts away his first wife? Is the moral originality
of the Gospel teaching to be established by merely ignoring all
previous teaching to the same effect?</p>
<p class="par">But it is hardly necessary thus to revert to the
question of the ethical originality of the Gospel teaching: the
essential issue here is the impossible combination presented to us by
M. Loisy as his historical Jesus. Without any sign of misgiving he
offers us the figure of a mystic awaiting the imminent end of the old
order of things and the substitution of a new and heavenly order,
doubled with a moralist deeply preoccupied over certain details of the
vanishing life and a prescription for their regulation in the future in
which they were not to exist. M. Loisy is, indeed, liable to be
censured by the orthodox and the &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; alike for his
explicit avowal that &ldquo;It is very superfluous <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>to
seek in the Gospel a doctrine of social economy, or even a program of
moral conduct for individual existences which were to go on according
to the order of nature, in the indefinite sequence of
humanity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4225src" href="#xd21e4225"
name="xd21e4225src">17</a> This seems to overlook the passage
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2025:34-46">Mt.
xxv, 34&ndash;46</a>) in which eternal life is promised to those who
succour the distressed. Such a rule for conduct does seem to indicate
some regard for the continuance of life on the normal lines. It is, we
know, a simple adaptation from the ritual of the Egyptian <span class=
"sc">Book of the Dead</span>, but it has had from many commentators
even such praise for &ldquo;originality&rdquo; as M. Loisy has bestowed
on the Teaching in general.</p>
<p class="par">Such teaching is, in point of fact, quite undeserving of
praise for &ldquo;spirituality,&rdquo; inasmuch as it in effect
recommends benevolence as a way of securing eternal life. He who
succours the distressed on the motive so supplied is plainly a long way
below the Good Samaritan or the simple compassionate human being of
everyday life. But this is really the ground-note of all the Gospel
ethic. The Beatitudes are promises of compensatory bliss; and, indeed,
in a system which founds upon immortality there is no escape from this
kind of motivation. The Pagan appeal, made alternately to nobleness and
to concern for good repute among one&rsquo;s fellows, is clearly on the
higher plane, and would tend to maintain, so far as mere moral appeal
can, a nobler type of human being. It is not even clear, in the light
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>the general Judaism of the doctrine of the
Kingdom, whether &ldquo;one of these my brethren&rdquo; can mean more
than &ldquo;one of the faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But however that may be, we have to note that for M.
Loisy the promise of reward at the judgment for help given to the
distressed is not a Jesuine utterance. It occurs only in Matthew; and
we may readily agree that, if such an allocution were really delivered
by the alleged Founder, it could not conceivably have been left to one
collector to preserve it. &ldquo;The redactor of the first
Gospel,&rdquo; comments M. Loisy in his best critical vein,
&ldquo;thought he ought to put this here to complete his collection of
instructions concerning the <i>parousia</i> and the great judgment. It
is ... a piece in which is developed, from the point of view of the
last judgment, the word of the Lord: &lsquo;He that receiveth you
receiveth me.&rsquo;&rdquo; So that a teaching which still makes a
great impression on the Christian consciousness is confessedly but a
development by an unknown hand of a bare Messianic phrase. &ldquo;It
has been visibly arranged to close the compilation of discourses and
parables made here by the redactor of the first Gospel.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4245src" href="#xd21e4245" name=
"xd21e4245src">18</a></p>
<p class="par">Yet when we come to the parable of the Good Samaritan,
which occurs only in Luke, and which also cannot be conceived as being
deliberately omitted by the previous evangelists if it had been uttered
by the Master, M. Loisy indulges in a very long discourse that reads
like a preserved sermon, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href=
"#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>only to conclude that &ldquo;the
parable of the Samaritan thus offers itself as one of the most
authentic testimonies [<i lang="fr">un t&eacute;moignage authentique
entre tous</i>] of the teaching of Jesus. It is clear that the
evangelist has not invented it, but that he has found it ready made,
and that he has only given it a frame, in his fashion.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4257src" href="#xd21e4257" name=
"xd21e4257src">19</a> It is with a certain embarrassment over the
spectacle of a good scholar&rsquo;s divagation that one proceeds to
point to the absolute <i lang="la">non sequitur</i> in M. Loisy&rsquo;s
comment. Supposing we agree that the evangelist found the parable ready
made, wherein is this case differentiated from that of the passage in
Matthew last noted? That is at least as likely to have been found ready
made; yet it is not in that case claimed by M. Loisy that the passage
is therefore a record of a real Jesuine utterance. He sees that it is a
&ldquo;patch,&rdquo; a development.</p>
<p class="par">Now, the parable of the Good Samaritan is a plain
documentary &ldquo;patch,&rdquo; an insertion without context, between
the address of Jesus to the disciples after that to the returned
Seventy (whose mission M. Loisy had somewhat nervously dismissed as the
evangelist&rsquo;s &ldquo;figurative frame for the evangelizing of the
pagans&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4267src" href="#xd21e4267"
name="xd21e4267src">20</a>) and the resumption: &ldquo;Now, as they
went on their way....&rdquo; It is impossible to imagine a more
palpable insertion. First the mythic Seventy, the creation of a
Gentilizing Christian, make their report on the exact lines of the
report of the Twelve; then Jesus addresses <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>them; then he &ldquo;rejoices in the Holy
Spirit.&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;turning to the disciples, he said
<i>privately</i>, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye
see....&rdquo; This last suggests an earlier allocution to the Twelve
which has had to be turned into a &ldquo;private&rdquo; speech to them
to distinguish it from the reply to the Seventy.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4277src" href="#xd21e4277" name="xd21e4277src">21</a> But however
that may be, the natural sequel is verse 38, &ldquo;Now, as they went
on their way....&rdquo; And it is between these points of natural
connection that we get the parable episode beginning: &ldquo;And
behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Well may M. Loisy say that the episode is a thing
&ldquo;found ready made&rdquo;; it has certainly no place in the
original document. But it was &ldquo;made&rdquo; by a later hand, and
it was inserted either by him who made it or by him who
&ldquo;found&rdquo; it. It is the work of a Gentilizer, aiming at
Jewish priests and Levites, and in a less degree at the scribes, whom
he treats as comparatively open to instruction. It is part of the
Gentilizing propaganda which evolved the story of the mission of the
Seventy, and it is naturally inserted after that episode. But to admit
<i>that</i> to be a work of redaction and to call the parable a genuine
Jesuine utterance is only to give one more distressing illustration of
the common collapse of the simplest principles of documentary criticism
under the sway of conservative prepossession. M. Loisy retains the
parable of the Good Samaritan as Jesuine simply because he feels that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>to abandon it is to come near making an end of
the claim for the moral originality of the Gospels. It is probably from
a Gentile hand, though it may conceivably have come from an enlightened
Jew.</p>
<p class="par">And so we find M. Loisy, with all his scholarly
painstaking and his laudable measure of candour, presenting us finally
with an uncritical result. His historical Jesus will not cohere. It is
a blend of early Judaic eschatology with later ethical common sense,
early Judaic humanity and particularism with later Gentile
universalism; even as the Gospels are a mosaic of a dozen other
diverging and conflicting tendencies, early and late. &ldquo;One can
explain to oneself Jesus,&rdquo; exclaims M. Loisy; &ldquo;one cannot
explain to oneself those who invented him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4289src" href="#xd21e4289" name="xd21e4289src">22</a> Let the
reader judge for himself whether M. Loisy has given us any explanation;
and whether, after our survey, there is any scientific difficulty in
the conception of an imaginary personage produced, like an ideal
photograph resulting from a whole series of superimposed portraits, by
the continued travail of generations of men variously bent on picturing
a Messiah for their hopes, a God for their salvation, and a Teacher for
their lives. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=

<h2 class="main">THE PAULINE PROBLEM</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">How much M. Loisy is swayed by prepossession may
be further gathered from his argumentation over the &ldquo;testimony of
Paul&rdquo; in connection with his criticism of the myth theory.
Professor Drews, he remarks, does not follow those who contest the
authenticity of the Epistles, &ldquo;though the interest of his thesis
imperiously demands it&rdquo;; and again: &ldquo;Paul is a dangerous
witness for the mythic hypothesis.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4306src" href="#xd21e4306" name="xd21e4306src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">It may be worth while for me here to note that a study
of the Pauline epistles, on the view that &ldquo;the four&rdquo; were
probably genuine in the main, was a determining factor in my own resort
to the mythical hypothesis. The critical situation created by realizing
that Paul practically knew nothing of the Gospel narratives save the
detachable item of the resurrection was for me almost exactly analogous
to that created by realizing that the Israel of the Book of Judges knew
nothing of the Pentateuchal life in the wilderness. So far from being a
witness against the myth theory, the Pauline literature was one of the
first clear grounds for that theory. The school of Van Manen can
realize, what M. Loisy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href=
"#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>cannot, that the spuriousness of
the whole Pauline literature, so far from being &ldquo;imperiously
required&rdquo; by the myth theory, sets up for that a certain
complication.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4317src" href="#xd21e4317"
name="xd21e4317src">2</a> As a matter of fact, Van Manen took exactly
the converse view to that of M. Loisy:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">He was at bottom a man of conservative character,
and it was only with great reluctance that he found himself compelled
to abandon the Paul consecrated by tradition. But when, as a man of
science, he had once made this sacrifice to his convictions, his belief
in an historical Jesus received a fresh accession of strength; now at
length the existence of Jesus had become probable. If the letters were
written a century later than the time when Jesus lived, then his
deification in the Pauline letters ceases to be so
astonishing.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4326src" href="#xd21e4326"
name="xd21e4326src">3</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Decidedly M. Loisy had been somewhat superficial in his
estimate of the tendencies of the argument over Paul. Now, the myth
theory, as it happens, is neither made nor marred by any decision as to
the spuriousness of the Pauline letters. The crucial point is that,
whether early or late&mdash;and the dating of them as pseudepigrapha is
a difficult matter&mdash;the cardinal epistles <i>have been
interpolated</i>. This became clear to me at an early stage in my
studies, independently of any previous criticism. That the two
passages, <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2011:23-28">1
Cor. xi, 23&ndash;28</a>; <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:3-11">xv,
3&ndash;11</a>, are interpolations, and that in the second case <i>the
interpolation has been added to</i>, are as clear results of pure
documentary analysis as any in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187"
href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>whole field of the
discussion.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4348src" href="#xd21e4348" name=
"xd21e4348src">4</a> And when M. Loisy ascribes to Professor Drews an
&ldquo;entirely gratuitous hypothesis of interpolation,&rdquo; and
implies that such hypotheses are set up because the texts are
&ldquo;extremely awkward for the mythic theory,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4354src" href="#xd21e4354" name="xd21e4354src">5</a>
he is himself misled by his <i>parti pris</i>. Whereas I came to my
conclusions<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4364src" href="#xd21e4364" name=
"xd21e4364src">6</a> as to interpolation while working towards the myth
theory, exactly the same conclusions as mine, I afterwards found, had
been previously reached by at least one continental scholar<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4367src" href="#xd21e4367" name="xd21e4367src">7</a>
who had not the mythic theory in view; and later by others<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4373src" href="#xd21e4373" name="xd21e4373src">8</a>
who equally stood aloof from it. M. Loisy would do well to ask himself
whether it is not he who is uncritically swayed by his presuppositions,
and whether the men to whom he imputes such bias are not the really
disinterested critics.</p>
<p class="par">In regard to the text of <a class="biblink xd21e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:3">1 Cor.
xv, 3</a> <i>sq.</i>, he describes as surprising the argument that the
account of the appearance of Jesus to &ldquo;five hundred at
once&rdquo; is shown to be late by its absence from the Gospels. This
very silence of the evangelists, he insists, &ldquo;renders unplausible
[<i lang="fr">invraisemblable</i>] the entirely gratuitous hypothesis
of an interpolation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4393src" href=
"#xd21e4393" name="xd21e4393src">9</a> One is driven to wonder what
conception M. Loisy has formed of the manner of the compilation
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>of the Gospels. On his view, Paul had very early
put in currency the record that the risen Jesus had appeared to
&ldquo;above five hundred brethren at once&rdquo;; yet this record, so
welcome to the Church, was never inserted in the Gospels. Why not? In
M. Loisy&rsquo;s opinion, one of them, at least, was penned or redacted
in the Pauline interest:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">One may <i>without doubt</i> ... affirm that the
oldest of the synoptics, the Gospel of Mark, was composed, in a certain
measure, in favour of Paul.... The same Gospel seems to have the
conscious purpose of lowering the Galilean disciples to the advantage
of Paul and his disciples.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4409src" href=
"#xd21e4409" name="xd21e4409src">10</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">And while M. Loisy justly rejects, as opposed to the
internal evidence, the claim that &ldquo;Luke&rdquo; is the intimate of
Paul, and even denies that the third Gospel is really Pauline in
tendency,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4416src" href="#xd21e4416" name=
"xd21e4416src">11</a> he will hardly say that it is anti-Pauline, or
likely on that or any other score to repel an important item of
testimony to the appearances of the risen Jesus, supplied by such an
authority as the Apostle to the Gentiles. He can give no reason
whatever, then, why the &ldquo;five hundred&rdquo; item should appear
neither in Gospels nor Acts. It is in point of fact to be taken as a
very late interpolation indeed. And if M. Loisy, as in duty bound,
would but note the sequence: &ldquo;then to <i>the twelve</i>; then ...
to above five hundred ... then <i>to all the apostles</i>,&rdquo; he
might, as simple critic, see that there have been successive
tamperings.</p>
<p class="par">As to the genuineness and the dating of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>epistles, it may be well at this point to put
the issue clearly. The general case of Van Manen is decidedly strong;
and the entire absence from the Acts of any mention of any public
epistle by Paul is all in Van Manen&rsquo;s favour. The Epistle to the
Romans is so far dissolved under criticism that it might be classed as
neither Pauline nor an epistle.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4434src"
href="#xd21e4434" name="xd21e4434src">12</a> That there are late
literary elements in the rest of the cardinal &ldquo;four&rdquo; I have
myself argued,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4440src" href="#xd21e4440"
name="xd21e4440src">13</a> independently of the question of the
interpolations of quasi-history. For a free historical student there
can be no primary question of how the dating of the epistles will
affect the problem of the historicity of Jesus: the problem is to be
scientifically solved on its merits. But while the school of Van Manen
fail to recognize interpolations in the epistles as they stand, and to
revise their chronology in the light of that fact, they are postponing
the critical settlement. That the rejection of all the Pauline epistles
as pseudepigraphic is not at all a counter stroke to the myth theory is
shown by Mr. Whittaker&rsquo;s definite acceptance of both positions.
Van Manen was premature on the historicity question.</p>
<p class="par">Assuredly there is much to be done before the myth
theory can be reduced to a definitive scientific form. It is to be
hoped that, free as it is from perverting commitments, it may be
developed rather more rapidly than the &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; theory of
the human <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>Christ, which has been on the stocks for over a
hundred years without securing any higher measure of unanimity than
exists among the Christian sects. But it can have no rapid acceptance.
Questions of myth analogies&mdash;always open to the perverse handling
of men who cannot or will not see that in mythology and anthropology
claims of analogy are not claims of derivation&mdash;are apt to be
obscure at best; and the establishment of the hypothesis of a
pre-Christian Jesus cult has been admitted from the outset to be
difficult. And the sociological history of the rise of Christianity, to
which the myth question is but preparatory, has still to be
written.</p>
<p class="par">In this direction too there may be complications. Pastor
Kalthoff&rsquo;s very important treatise on <span class="sc">The Rise
of Christianity</span> puts the theory that the Church began as a
communistic body; and Karl Kautsky, in his <span class="sc" lang=
"de">Der Ursprung des Christenthums</span> (1908), has vigorously
developed that conception. It has some strong grounds, and it is beset
by very serious difficulties, which Kautsky, I think, has not met. When
he denies that there were Hellenistic experiments and propagandas which
in a later period could have set some Christian enthusiasts upon
inventing a communistic beginning for the Church, he seems to ignore
his own argument from the Epistle of James, and evidence which he could
have found in Kalthoff. But unless the communistic theory (adumbrated
long ago in De Quincey&rsquo;s rash thesis that the Essenes were the
first Christians) is pressed as giving the <i>whole</i> origin of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>Christianity, it remains a part rather of the
sociological problem than of the hierological inquiry. And I do not
think that Kalthoff, had he lived, would have so pressed it. He saw, I
think, that there is a primary <i>religious</i> factor and problem, and
that the other is secondary. There was a sacramental cult before there
could be any communism. When the origin of the cult is made fairly
clear the question of communism may be settled. But the Acts is a very
dubious basis for a historical theory, and the Epistle of James tells
rather of Ebionism than of communism. The history of the Ebionites and
the Nazarenes, which for me was one of the points of reversion to a
myth theory, seems to be the true starting point for the history of the
Church. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=

<h2 class="main">THE HISTORY OF THE DISCUSSION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In all things, finally, one must be prepared for a
boundless operation of the spirit of controversy, which is as it were
the atmosphere of intellectual progress, and, like the physical
atmosphere, is traversed by much dust, many gusts, and many persistent
currents. An infinite quantity of mere insolence and mere personal
aspersion arises round every problem that disturbs widespread
prejudice: we have seen some of it even in a survey which aims solely
at bringing out the main arguments on our issue. And where a body of
doctrine is related to an economic foundation, controversy is sure to
be specially protracted.</p>
<p class="par">This has already been abundantly seen in the development
of the &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; view of the human Christ, of which M.
Loisy may be taken as an advanced representative; while Professor
Schmiedel may rank as an exponent too advanced to be otherwise than
suspect for some of the school. It is instructive to realize that M.
Loisy stands to-day very much where Strauss did eighty years ago. What
was then revolutionary heresy is now become a very respectable form of
professional theology. Only in his old age did Strauss himself realize
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>what philosophical conclusions his critical
method led; and on the historicity question he seems to have made no
serious advance at all. Challenged by Ullmann to say whether, on his
theory, the Church created the Christ of the Gospels or he the Church,
Strauss replied that the alternative was false, and that both things
had happened; the Christ being created by the faith of the Church,
which faith in turn was created by the person of the historical Jesus.
From that gyratory position he never really departed; and that is the
position of M. Loisy to-day.</p>
<p class="par">If it has taken eighty years to yield only that amount
of progress, through a whole library of laborious scholarly literature,
there can be no great weight left in the appeal to scholarly authority.
The authority of to-day is the heretic of our grandfathers&rsquo; day.
It is for the radical innovator, on the other hand, to learn the lesson
which was not duly learned by his predecessors, unless it be that in
some cases they were merely silenced by orthodox hostility. While many
Freethinkers, probably, had come privately to the view of those
intimates of Bolingbroke who are referred to by Voltaire as denying the
historicity of Jesus, the two writers who first gave European vogue to
the proposition, Dupuis and Volney, staked everything on the
astronomical elements of the cult, and on the chief myth-analogies with
Pagan religions. Their argument was both sound and important, so far as
it went; but for lack of investigation on the Jewish side of the
problem, and of the necessary analysis <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>of the Gospels, they
failed to make any serious impression on the scholars, especially as so
many Freethinking critics, down to Reimarus and Voltaire, treated the
historicity of Jesus as certain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4484src"
href="#xd21e4484" name="xd21e4484src">1</a> And when an anonymous
German writer in 1799 published a treatise on Revelation and Mythology
in which, according to Strauss, he posited the whole life of Jesus as
pre-conceived in Jewish myth and speculation, he made no impression on
an age busily and vainly occupied with the so-called
&ldquo;rationalizing&rdquo; of myths and miracles by reducing them to
natural events misunderstood.</p>
<p class="par">Later, another&mdash;or the same?&mdash;anonymous
German, also cited by Strauss, in a review article condemned every
attempt to find a historical basis for the Gospel myths; but in both
cases the anonymity sufficiently told of the general resentment against
any such view. And when Strauss himself, the first to handle the
problem with an approach to scientific thoroughness, not only adhered
to the central assumption of historicity, but argued confidently that
the mythical dissolution of so many of the details made no difference
to faith, it was natural that interest in his undertaking should
slacken. The fact that it had ruined his career would perhaps count for
still more. Freedom of academic discussion in Germany has never meant
any minimizing of pious malice; and Strauss all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>his
life long had to bear his cross for the offence of a new advance in
historical science.</p>
<p class="par">Dr. Albert Schweitzer, who for almost the first time,
after Schmiedel, has brought the note of amenity into the argument for
historicity as against the negative, remarks that the greatest Lives of
Jesus are those which have been written with hate&mdash;to wit, those
by Reimarus and Strauss. Reimarus, whom Dr. Schweitzer genially
overrates, was indeed given to invective against mythological
personages, from Moses downward; but &ldquo;hate&rdquo; is a strange
term to apply to the calm and judicial procedure of Strauss. As well
ascribe to hate the rise of Unitarianism. If hate is to be the term for
Strauss&rsquo;s mood, what epithet is left for that of his opponents,
who, as Dr. Schweitzer relates, circled him with unsleeping malignity
to the end, and sought to ostracize the clerical friend of his youth
who delivered an address over his grave? It is only historic religion
that can foster and sustain such hates as these. It is true that Bruno
Bauer, who so suddenly advanced upon Strauss&rsquo;s position,
detecting new elements of mythic construction in the Gospels, and
arriving ten years later at the definite doctrine of non-historicity,
exhibited a play of storm and stress in the earlier part of his
inquiry. He reviled at that stage, not the Jesus whose
&ldquo;life&rdquo; he was investigating, but the theologians who had so
confounded confusion. &ldquo;These outbreaks of bitterness,&rdquo; Dr.
Schweitzer admits, &ldquo;are to be explained by the feeling of
repulsion which German apologetic theology inspired in every genuinely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>honest and thoughtful man by the methods which
it adopted in opposing Strauss.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4495src" href="#xd21e4495" name="xd21e4495src">2</a> Add that the
same methods were being employed towards Bauer, and the case is perhaps
simplified.</p>
<p class="par">With these cases before him, and with the record to
write of a hundred and thirty years of admittedly abortive discussion,
Dr. Schweitzer could not forgo an exordium in praise of the
&ldquo;German temperament&rdquo; which had so wonderfully kept the
discussion going. Such a record seems a surprising ground for national
pride; but it may be granted him that the German temperament will never
lack material for self-panegyric, which appears to be the breath of its
nostrils. To those, however, for whom science is independent of
nationality, the lesson has a somewhat different aspect. What has been
lacking is scientific thoroughness. Bruno Bauer&rsquo;s flaws of mood
and method were such that his more radical penetration of the problem
at certain points made no such impression as did the orderly and
temperate procedure of Strauss. &ldquo;One might suppose that between
the work of Strauss and that of Bauer there lay not five but fifty
years&mdash;the critical work of a whole generation.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4505src" href="#xd21e4505" name="xd21e4505src">3</a>
&ldquo;Bauer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Criticism of the Gospel History&rsquo; is
worth a good dozen Lives of Jesus, because his work, as we are only now
coming to recognize, after half a century, is the ablest and most
complete collection of the difficulties of the Life of Jesus which is
anywhere to be found.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4508src" href=
"#xd21e4508" name="xd21e4508src">4</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">But his mood and his method not only made him fail to
establish his mythical theory; they meant miscarriage in the very
conception of it&mdash;a mere substitution of a subjective notion for
the method of inductive science. Bauer&rsquo;s final way of putting the
theory merely discredits it. He decides that the whole myth was the
creation of one evangelist, whereby he shows that he is no mythologist.
He never reached the true myth basis. After all, &ldquo;the German
temperament&rdquo; seems to fall short, at some rather essential
points, of the faculty for solving great historical problems; one feels
it somewhat acutely when Dr. Schweitzer comes to the undertaking
himself.</p>
<p class="par">The great merit of Schweitzer&rsquo;s book is its manly
and genial tone; though, as this is freely bestowed on the most extreme
heretics, he may make another impression when he speaks of the
&ldquo;inconceivable stupidity&rdquo; of the average Life of Jesus in
the treatment of the connection of events. What his book mainly
demonstrates is the laborious futility of the age-long discussion
maintained by the professional theologians of Germany. When he comes to
the latest developments, which are but extensions of the common-sense
analyses of Bruno Bauer, he is full of admiration for criticisms which,
I can testify, have occurred spontaneously to unpretending Freethinkers
with no claim to special training. Some of the most important myth
elements in the Gospels&mdash;for instance, the story of
Barabbas&mdash;he does not even glance at, having apparently, like the
other specialists, never realized that there is anything there to
explain. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">By Dr. Schweitzer&rsquo;s account, the great mass of the
German specialists for a century past have been unable to see
contradictions and incompatibilities in the Gospels which leap to the
eyes; to himself, Wrede&rsquo;s statement of some of them appears to be
a revelation. It would seem that the simple old
&ldquo;Secularist&rdquo; method of exposing these had covered ground
which for the specialists was wholly unexplored. Thus it comes about
that the myth theory, addressed to men who had never realized the
character of their own perpetually conned documents, fared as it might
have done if addressed to the Council of Trent.</p>
<p class="par">Of no myth-theories save those of Bruno Bauer and Pastor
Kalthoff, which alike ignore the clues of mythology and anthropology,
does Dr. Schweitzer seem to have any knowledge. He is capable of giving
a senseless account of a book he has not seen, and, it may be, of one
he has seen. Of <span class="sc">Christianity and Mythology</span> he
alleges that &ldquo;according to that work the Christ-myth is merely a
form of the Krishna-myth&rdquo;&mdash;a proposition which tells only of
absolute ignorance concerning the book. If, as I suspect, he has no
better ground for his account of Hennell&rsquo;s <span class=
"sc">Inquiry</span> as &ldquo;nothing more than Venturini&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Non-miraculous History of the Great Prophet of Nazareth&rsquo;
tricked out with a fantastic paraphernalia of learning,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4530src" href="#xd21e4530" name="xd21e4530src">5</a>
it speaks ill for the regular functioning of his critical conscience.
But where he has to deal with concrete arguments <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>he
is straightforward, alert, and readily appreciative; and his survey as
a whole leads up to a complete dismissal of the whole work of the
liberal school so-called. In his summing-up, the only critical choice
left is between &ldquo;complete scepticism&rdquo; and &ldquo;complete
eschatology&rdquo;&mdash;that is, between the avowal that there is no
evidence for a historical Jesus, and the conviction that the historical
Jesus was purely and simply a Jewish &ldquo;hero and dreamer,&rdquo;
whose entire doctrine was the advent of the kingdom of God, the ending
of the old order, in which consummation he <i>secretly</i> believed he
was to figure as the Messiah.</p>
<p class="par">The bare statement of the proposition hardly reveals its
significance. Dr. Schweitzer&rsquo;s &ldquo;dreamer&rdquo; is not M.
Loisy&rsquo;s, who is conceived as having had something to teach to his
disciples, and even to the multitude. Dr. Schweitzer&rsquo;s Jesus has,
indeed, disciples for no assignable reason, but he is expressly
declared to be no Teacher, even as Wrede&rsquo;s Teacher is expressly
declared to be no Messiah. The joint result is to leave the ground
tolerably clear for the scientific myth theory, of which Dr. Schweitzer
has not come within sight, having omitted to inquire about it. As he
sums up:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Supposing that only a half&mdash;nay, only a
third&mdash;of the critical arguments which are common to Wrede and the
&ldquo;Sketch of the Life of Jesus&rdquo; [by Schweitzer] are sound,
<i>then the modern historical view of the history is wholly ruined</i>.
The reader of Wrede&rsquo;s book cannot help feeling that here no
quarter is given; and any one who goes carefully through the present
writer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sketch&rdquo; must come <span class=

<h2 class="main">THE GROUND CLEARED FOR THE MYTH THEORY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The issue as between Schweitzer and Wrede comes to
this. Wrede sees that the Messiahship is a creation following upon the
belief in the resurrection, and only uncritically deducible from the
documents. For him, Jesus is a Teacher who was made into a Messiah by
his followers after his death, the Gospels being manipulated to conceal
the fact that he made no Messianic claims. Schweitzer sees that the
Teaching Jesus is a documentary construction; and that, unless the
Crucified One had <i>some</i> Messianic idea, the Gospel story as a
whole crumbles to nothing. And he asks:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">But how did the appearance of the risen Jesus
suddenly become for them [the disciples] a proof of His Messiahship and
the basis of their eschatology? That Wrede fails to explain, and so
makes this &ldquo;event&rdquo; an &ldquo;historical&rdquo; miracle
which in reality is harder to believe than the supernatural
event.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4571src" href="#xd21e4571" name=
"xd21e4571src">1</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">So be it: Wrede&rsquo;s thesis is here, after all, part
of the common content of the &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; ideal, which cannot
stand. But how does his critic make good the converse of a would-be
Messiah who was no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202"
name="pb202">202</a>]</span>Teacher, but yet had disciples, and was
finally crucified for making a <i>secret</i> Messianic claim? The
answer is too na&iuml;ve to be guessed. Accepting, in defiance of every
suggestion of common sense, the story of the triumphal entry into
Jerusalem, Dr. Schweitzer decides that &ldquo;the episode was Messianic
for Jesus, but not Messianic for the people.&rdquo; With no authority
save the documents which at this point he radically and recklessly
alters, he decides that the multitude had hailed Jesus &ldquo;as the
Prophet, as Elias,&rdquo; whatever the texts may say; and Jesus,
feeling he was the Messiah, &ldquo;played with his Messianic
self-consciousness&rdquo; all the while. Why, then, was he put to
death? Simply because Judas betrayed his secret to the priests! Dr.
Schweitzer can see well enough the futility of the betrayal story as it
stands, inasmuch as Judas is paid to do what was not
required&mdash;identifying a well-known public figure. But rather than
admit myth here he will invent a better story for himself, and we get
this: Jesus had dropped Messianic hints to his disciples, and Judas
sold the information. And all the while none of the other disciples
knew this, though at the trial the priests went among the people and
induced them &ldquo;not to agree to the Procurator&rsquo;s proposal.
How? By telling them why He was condemned; by revealing to them the
Messianic secret. That makes him at once from a prophet worthy of
honour into a deluded enthusiast and blasphemer.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4583src" href="#xd21e4583" name="xd21e4583src">2</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In the name of the Prophet, figs!&rdquo; Dr.
Schweitzer has, he believes, saved the character of &ldquo;the mob of
Jerusalem&rdquo; at last; and by what a device! By assuming that to
claim to be the Messiah was to blaspheme, which it certainly was
<i>not</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4594src" href="#xd21e4594" name=
"xd21e4594src">3</a> and by assuming that the mob who had (on
Schweitzer&rsquo;s view) acclaimed an Elias would be struck dumb with
horror on being told that Elias claimed to be the Messiah. The secret
of this psychosis is in Dr. Schweitzer&rsquo;s sole possession, as is
the explanation of the total absence of his statement from all the
literature produced by the generation which, on his assumption, knew
all about the case. And this is what is left after a survey of the
German exegesis &ldquo;from Reimarus to Wrede.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It is to be feared that neither the scholars nor the
laity will accept either of Dr. Schweitzer&rsquo;s alternatives, and
that the nature of his own prestidigitatory solution may tend somewhat
to weaken the effect of his indictment of the kaleidoscopic process
which has hitherto passed as a solution among the experts. Dr.
Schweitzer seems to realize all absurdities save his own. None the
less, he has done a critical service in arguing down all the rest,
though even in his final verdict he exhibits symptoms of the
&ldquo;sacred disease,&rdquo; the theologian&rsquo;s malady of
self-contradiction:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p class="par">&ldquo;Loves me, loves me not,&rdquo; as the little
girls say in counting the flower petals. We seem entitled to suggest in
the interests of simple science, as distinguished from Germanic
<i>Kultur</i>, that temperament might perhaps usefully be left out of
the debate; and that the question of what Jesus stands for may be left
over till we have settled whether the film presented to us by Dr.
Schweitzer can stand between us and a scientific criticism which
assents to all of his verdict save the reservation in favour of his own
thesis.</p>
<p class="par">Meantime, let us not seem to suggest that the English
handling of the historical problem during the nineteenth century has
been any more scientific than the German. Hennell&rsquo;s treatment of
it was but a simplification of Strauss&rsquo;s; and Thomas
Scott&rsquo;s Life of Jesus was but an honest attempt to solidify
Renan. In the early part of the nineteenth century little was achieved
beyond the indispensable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href=
"#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>weakening of the reign of
superstition by critical propaganda. In early Victorian England, where
Freethought had been left to unprofessional freelances, still liable to
brutal prosecution, an anonymous attempt was made to carry the matter
further in a curious book entitled &ldquo;The Existence of Christ
Disproved by Irresistible Evidence, in a Series of Letters by a German
Jew.&rdquo; It bears no date, but seems to have been published between
1841 and 1849, appearing serially in thirty penny weekly numbers,
printed in Birmingham, and published in London by Hetherington. As
Hetherington, who died in 1849, was imprisoned in 1840 for the
&ldquo;blasphemous libel&rdquo; of publishing Haslam&rsquo;s
<span class="sc">Letters to the Clergy</span>, but not earlier or later
on any similar charge, he would seem to have been allowed to publish
this without molestation.</p>
<p class="par">About the author I have no information. He writes
English fluently and idiomatically, and had read Strauss in the
original. But though he presses against Hennell the argument from the
case of Apollos, latterly developed by Professor W. B. Smith with such
scholarly skill, the book as a whole has little persuasive power. The
author is one of the violent and vehement men who alone, in the day of
persecution, were likely to hazard such a thesis; and he does it with
an amount of vociferation much in excess of his critical effort or his
knowledge. It made, and could make, no impression whatever on the
educated world; and I never met any Freethinker who had seen or heard
of it.</p>
<p class="par">It is in another spirit, and in the light of a far
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>greater accumulation of evidence than was
available in the first half of the last century, that the mythical
theory has been restated in our day. In particular it proceeds upon a
treasury of anthropological lore which was lacking to Bruno Bauer, as
it was to Ghillany, who was so much better fitted than Bauer to profit
by such light. As knowledge of the past gradually arranges itself into
science, and the malice of religious resistance recedes from point to
point before the sapping process of culture, the temper of the whole
debate undergoes a transmutation. After a generation in which a Lyell
could only in privacy avow his views as to the antiquity of man, came
that in which Tylor, without polemic, could establish an
anthropological method that was to mean the reduction of all religious
phenomena, on a new line, to the status of natural phenomena. And even
the malice of the bigoted faithful, which will subsist while the faith
endures, falls into its place as one of these, equally with the malice
of the conventional theorists who meet the exposure of their untenable
positions with aspersion in defect of argument.</p>
<p class="par">But the fact that a recent German exegete has been found
capable of facing the problem in a spirit of scientific candour and
good temper, and with something of the old-time detachment which made
Rosenkranz marvel at Carlyle&rsquo;s tone towards Diderot, may be a
promise of a more general resort to civilized controversial methods. In
any case, the fact that a trained New Testament critic, undertaking to
establish the historicity of Jesus, has <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>affirmed the
scientific failure of <i>all</i> the preceding attempts, and offered a
historic residuum which few will think worth an hour&rsquo;s
consideration, seems a sufficient demonstration that the mythical
theory is the real battleground of the future.</p>
<p class="par">In that connection it is interesting to note that Sir J.
G. Frazer, who has so warmly contended that, as history cannot be
explained &ldquo;without the influence of great men,&rdquo; we must
accept the historicity of Jesus,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4659src"
href="#xd21e4659" name="xd21e4659src">6</a> latterly propounds a
tentative theory of a historic original for Osiris, whom he supposes to
have been perhaps evolved from the idealized personality of an ancient
King Khent, buried at Abydos.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4679src" href=
"#xd21e4679" name="xd21e4679src">7</a> It is a mere suggestion, and it
at once evokes the reminder that, on the theorist&rsquo;s own general
principles, King Khent may be regarded as having been theocratically
identified with the already existing God. However that may be, the
hypothesis does nothing to save Sir James&rsquo;s irrelevant plea about
the operation of &ldquo;great men&rdquo; and &ldquo;extraordinary
minds&rdquo; in the founding of all religions, for he does not suggest
that King Khent&rsquo;s career in any way resembled the myth of Osiris,
or that he first taught the things Osiris is said to have taught. So
that, in the case of Osiris as of Jesus, the required great men and
extraordinary minds may still, in the terms of the claim, be inserted
at any point rather than in the personage named or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>suggested as Founder.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4695src" href="#xd21e4695" name="xd21e4695src">8</a> If we agree
to call the compiler of the Sermon on the Mount and the parables of the
Kingdom and the Prodigal Son and the Good Samaritan great men and
extraordinary minds, Sir James&rsquo;s very simple argument is turned.
And we should still be left asking who were the historic founders of
the cults of Zeus and Brahma and Attis and Adonis, Dionysos and
Herakles and Krishna and Aphrodite and Artemis.</p>
<p class="par">On the other hand, as it happens, that very suggestion
as to King Khent points afresh to the myth theory as the solution of
the Gospel problem. Nothing emerges oftener in Sir James&rsquo;s great
survey than the ancient connection between kingship and liability to
sacrifice. It will not avail to close off that connection by claiming
King Khent as a potentate of an age after that of sacrificed kings. The
sacrificial past would still have to be taken into account in
explaining the deification of King Khent. And it is just an analogous
process that is suggested in our theory of the Jesus myth. A long
series of slain Jesuses, ritually put to death at an annual sacrament
&ldquo;for the sins of many,&rdquo; is the ultimate anthropological
ground given for the special cultus out of which grew the mythical
biography of the Gospels.</p>
<p class="par">And if Sir James remains satisfied with his charge that
in putting such a theory we &ldquo;flatter the vanity of the
vulgar,&rdquo; we may be permitted to ask him which line of propaganda
is likeliest to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209"
name="pb209">209</a>]</span>appeal to the multitude. Let him, in his
turn, be on his guard against the vulgarity which seeks support in
science from popular prejudice. As to his pronouncement that the theory
which he so inexpensively attacks &ldquo;will find no favour with the
philosophic historian,&rdquo; one must just point out that it does not
lie with him to draw up the conclusions of philosophic history outside
of his own great department, or even, for that matter, <i>in</i> that
department. His own historical generalizations, when they seek to pass
from the strictly anthropological to the sociological status, will
often really not bear the slightest critical analysis. They express at
times an entire failure to realize the nature of a historical process,
offering as they do mere chance speculations which patently conflict
with the whole mass of the evidence he has himself collected. It is not
an isolated opinion that by such abortive attempts at
&ldquo;philosophic history&rdquo; he has tended to lessen the
usefulness even of that collection, for which all students are his
grateful debtors. In short, he would do well to turn from his ill-timed
incursion into dogmatics to the relevant problem which he has forced
upon so many of his readers&mdash;namely, What has become of his
mythological maxim that the ritual precedes the myth?</p>
<p class="par">While the professed mythologist rejects the application
of the myth theory to the current religion in the name of
&ldquo;philosophic history,&rdquo; students ostensibly more concerned
about religion reject the historicity theory in the name of their
religious ideals, finding in the myth theory the vindication
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>of these. Thus Professor Drews has from the
first connected the argument of his <span class="sc" lang="de">Das
Christusmythe</span> with a claim to regenerate religion by freeing it
from anthropomorphism; and I have seen other theistic pronouncements to
the same effect; to say nothing of the declarations of scholarly
Churchmen that for them the Jesus of the Gospels is a God or nothing,
and that for them the historicity argument has no religious value. Such
positions seem to me, equation for equation, very sufficiently to
balance the bias of Sir James Frazer. For my own part, I am content to
maintain the theory in the name of science, and it is by scientific
tests that I invite the reader to try it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Enough has now been said to make it clear to the
open-minded reader that the myth-theory is no wanton challenge to
belief in a clear and credible historical narrative. It is not the
advocates of the myth-theory who have raised the issue. The trouble
began with the attempts of the believers to solve their own
difficulties. Before the rise of criticism so-called we find them
hating and burning each other in their quarrels over the meaning of
their central sacrament. As soon as criticism began to work on the
problem of the miracles and the contradictions in the narratives of
these, they set themselves to frame &ldquo;Harmonies&rdquo; of the
Gospels which only brought into clearer relief their discordance. After
the spread of scientific views had shaken the belief in miracles, they
set themselves, still as believers, to frame explanatory Lives of Jesus
in which miracles were dissolved into hallucinations or natural
episodes misunderstood; and, as before, no two explanations coincided.
A &ldquo;consensus of scholars&rdquo; has never existed.</p>
<p class="par">It was after a whole generation of German scholars had
laboured to extract a historical Jesus from the Gospel mosaic that
Strauss produced his powerful and sustained argument to show that most
of the separate episodes which they had arbitrarily striven
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>to reduce to history were but operations of the
mythop&oelig;ic faculty, proceeding upon the mass of Jewish prophecy
and legend under the impulse of the Messianic idea. Strauss was no
wanton caviller, but a great critic, forced to his work by the failure
of a multitude of <i lang="de">Gelehrten vom Fach</i> to extract a
credible result from what they admitted to be, as it stood, a history
in large part incredible.</p>
<p class="par">Strauss, in turn, believing at once in a residual
historical Jesus and in the perfect sufficiency of a mere ideal
personage as a standard for men&rsquo;s lives and a basis for their
churches, left but a new enigma to his successors. He had stripped the
nominal Founder of a mass of mythic accretions, but, attempting no new
portrait, left him undeniably more shadowy than before. Later
&ldquo;liberal&rdquo; criticism, tacitly accepting Strauss&rsquo;s
negations, set itself anew to extract from the Gospels, by a process of
more or less conscientious documentary analysis, the &ldquo;real&rdquo;
Jesus whom the critics and he agreed to have existed. Renan undertook
to do as much in his famous &ldquo;romance&rdquo;; and German critics,
who so characterized his work, produced for their part only much duller
romances, devoid of Renan&rsquo;s wistful artistic charm. And, as
before, every &ldquo;biographer&rdquo; in turn demurred to the results
of the others.</p>
<p class="par">It is the result of the utter inadequacy of all these
attempts to solve the historical problem, and of the ever-growing sense
of the inadequacy of a mere legendary construction to form a code for
human life and a basis for a cosmic philosophy, that independent
inquirers in various countries have set <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>about finding out the
real historical process of the rise of Christianity, dismissing the
worn-out convention. Small-minded conservatives at once exclaim, and
will doubtless go on saying, that those who thus explain away the
&ldquo;historical Jesus,&rdquo; are moved by their antipathy to
Christianity, and to theism in general. The assertion is childishly
false. One of the leading exponents of the myth-theory gives his
theism&mdash;or pantheism&mdash;as the primary inspiration of his work.
The present writer, as he has more than once explained, began by way of
writing a sociological history of the rise of Christianity on the
foundation of a historical Jesus with twelve disciples&mdash;this long
after coming to a completely naturalistic view of religion, which
excluded theism. From such a point of view there was no &agrave; priori
objection whatever to a historical Jesus. At one time he sketched a
hypothesis of several successive Jesuses. The intangibility of any
historical Jesus was the conclusion slowly forced by a long attempt to
clear the historical starting-point, supposed to be irreducible.</p>
<p class="par">Since that discovery was reached, the discrediting of
the conventional view has been carried to the verge of nihilism by men
who still posit a historical Jesus, but critically eliminate nearly
every accepted detail, leaving only a choice between two shadowy and
elusive historical concepts, even less tenable than those they reject.
In the works of Schweitzer and Wrede, there is literally more direct
and detailed destruction of Gospel-myth than had been attempted by
almost any advocate of the myth-theory who had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>preceded them; though, as we have seen, it is
not difficult to carry the process further. In the name of the
historicity claim, they have gone on eliminating one by one myth
elements where the myth-theorists had been content to recognize myth in
mass. He who would re-establish the historical Jesus has to combat,
first and foremost, the latest scientific champions of the belief in
the historicity.</p>
<p class="par">Those English critics who, like Dr. Conybeare, have
declaimed so loudly of a consensus of critics and of historical
common-sense on the side of a &ldquo;historical Christ,&rdquo; are
simply fulminating from the standpoint of the German
&ldquo;liberalism&rdquo; of thirty years ago. Nine-tenths of what they
violently affirm has been definitely and destructively rejected by the
latest German representatives of the critical class, in the very name
of the defence of the historicity of Jesus. Orthodox Germans, on the
other hand, have been pointing out that the &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; view
is no longer &ldquo;modern,&rdquo; the really modern criticism having
shown that the Gospel-figure is a God-figure or nothing. Vainly they
hope to reinforce orthodoxy by the operations of a strict critical
method.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4745src" href="#xd21e4745" name=
"xd21e4745src">1</a> Our English &ldquo;liberal-conservatives,&rdquo;
all the while, are fighting with obsolete (German) weapons, and in
total ignorance of the real course of the campaign in recent years.</p>
<p class="par">In such circumstances, those of us who did our thinking
for ourselves, without waiting for new German leads, have perhaps some
right to appeal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215"
name="pb215">215</a>]</span>anew to readers to do the same. There is no
race quarrel involved. But perhaps those students in the
English-speaking countries who in the past have been wont to follow the
German leads of the generation before their own, may now realize that
they were unduly diffident, and proceed to make that use of their own
faculties which Germans were always making from time to time.
